Everybody did a really great job and the sequences in the jets were just heart stopping. Such a fun ride. My only wish was that we got to know the characters a bit more.. mainly the new ones. The movie was really tight.. and I think it could have used a bit more room to breathe in between the action scenes.. and with the characters so we got to know them a bit more. But a great ride and I'm looking forward to seeing it again as soon as possible. So fun!I also really appreciated the filmmakers dedicating the movie to Tony Scott. Another legend that we lost way too soon. RIP Tony.. we miss you.A great movie from start to finish. Way to go!\n",

            "Review: I'll keep this brief. Massive fan of the original movie, I've seen it 30+ times and I know every line. The sequel.It owes a lot to the first film borrowing much of the story line from the first and it mirrors the plot very closely. Negatives first...I think the film was 15-20 minutes too long. I think the story dragged a little after a brilliant opening 30 minutes. There was no explaination of who the enemy was. The fighter pilots in training failed the mission everytime but then suddenly found the ability to complete the mission in real time. A good old fashioned montage would have been nice here. They re-used some of the one liners from the old movie which is nice but could have come up with new idea's. There was the odd chuckle in the movie which went down well but could have done with a few more.Onto the positives...The scenes with the jet are just incredbile. They certainly rival the first movie and better them with today's camera technology. The romantic scenes mirror a similar pattern to the first movie which are sweet. The nostalgia to the first movie brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions. The way they opened the movie paying homage to the first movie gave me tingles and throughout the movie I had goosebumps as it flashed back to the original movie.On the whole, it's a reason to go back to the cinema in years. After a long period of rubbish sequels, superhero movies, CGI movies and dreadful idea's, this is a properly old fashioned action movie. It's predictale, explosive and a beautiful way to lose your self for 2 hours or more.I think this films owes a lot to the first but they've done an excellent job. Would I re-watch this again? Probably once yes, but after watching this it made me want to re-watch the first Top Gun over and over again.As I said in the title, I think this is a love letter to the first movie and aviation. I only hope other film makers take note from the success of this film and keep it up.\n",

Cruise acts his butt off in this movie and props to Miles Teller for holding his own in this. Tom Cruise might just be \"the last great action hero\"! See this on the biggest screen you can find, it's worth it!\n",

            "Review: It was a good sequel but not that great or as outstanding as the reviews have suggested. It had a lot of missed opportunities with showing more cool footage of fighter jets etc. With a good soundtrack playing in the background. Only new song was Lady Gaga's but that was simply lame. Characters were ok but they, or Goose's son to be precise, didn't create too much attatchment. Luckily there were a couple of awesome scenes (like the liftoff of the new jet fighter in the beginning where you can feel the power of the aircraft and the end fight scene) which really made you feel the same tingling like in the original version. Also, I liked the new volleyball scene (I guess it was filmed better than the old one). All in all, a good first after-covid \"popcorn\" movie to see in filmtheatres.\n",

            "Review: 1. Still acts like San Diego is the same place it was in the eighties, which couldn't be further from the truth.2. Maverick is, career-wise and socially still in the same place he was in 1986, which is hard to believe.3. Despite having pictures all over Pacific Fleet's lobby and being a legend in Naval Aviation, today's young top aviators have no clue who Maverick is.4. Unnamed enemy nation has fifth-generation fighter jets but no nuclear weapons, which is simply impossible.5. SAM missiles are easily visible on mountains but while cruise missiles were sent to take the airfield out, none were sent to take out the SAMs, which would have made the mission a lot easier.6. Tiresome trope at the beginning where Tom Cruise crashes the experimental plane, ends up in a diner around the Southwest that looks like it time traveled from the seventies or eighties, from the restaurant to the clothes people wore. I traveled all around that area and no one dresses like that. They all dress like Americans do all over the country. Waitresses at diners also all wear polos and pants, they don't wear dresses from the eighties. Hollywood seems to still think flyover country hasn't changed since 40 years ago.7. Pretty sure fifth-generation fighters wouldn't have to engage in a dogfight at close range with an F/A-18.8. Perhaps the most ludicrous scene in the film, the Hind attack helicopter is searching for Maverick and chooses to fire at him instead of capturing him. That doesn't happen, not even in Ukraine. Pilots are valuable to use as bargaining chips. Even regular soldiers are as we've seen in the past couple decades. You would think an advisor would have told them that scene was dumb.9. Other than a brief mention at the beginning, the movie pretends drones don't exist, which is a missed opportunity. Along with the Ukraine War, it makes the film look dated.10. Too much nostalgia for the old film, from the soundtrack that was copy and pasted with no variation, the need to include Goose's son, which was unnecessary, including Ice as a Commander. Cruise also doesn't show his age. The film needed to go in its own direction, not act like it was set one year after the original Top Gun.11. The training for the bombing run wasn't realistic. They couldn't copy the canyon exactly. Much of what Maverick did is likely already being taught to top aviators or easily accomplished by tech. If you know a lot about military equipment, or more than your casual viewer, the film is kind of silly.Top Gun was alright, but a sequel just wasn't warranted and was guaranteed to be off. It's a decent watch once, but look for this to be quickly forgotten like that Independence Day sequel. The high praise and reviews are kind of unwarranted.\n",

            "Review: \"I have the need, the need for speed!\" So do moviegoers. That's why so many are gonna flock to 2022's Top Gun: Maverick. Wanting to see the sequel to the original Top Gun amidst its many delays, I was one of them. May seemed like the perfect month to get my Mach 10 on.More stunt-packed than the first Top Gun and probably more tech-savvy, \"Maverick\" at times readily lets you know it's a follow-up with fan-made propensities and fan service directed at Tom Cruise's legendary persona (Lt. Pete Mitchell). At the same timetable, Top Gun: Maverick also announces that it's cinematic spectacle and not much else. See it on the biggest screen possible but be forewarned, you won't be quoting any of its lines any time soon.Tom Cruise stars in \"Maverick\" (duh). As Lt. Mitchell, Cruise acts and talks differently than he did in '86. I don't know if it's old age or wisdom but Mitchell is now the consummate professional. Back then he didn't say much. He just acted cocky and kicked butt in the air. I mean in Top Gun: Maverick I thought he said he wasn't fit to be an instructor. Could've fooled me.\"Maverick\" flies by even at a running time of 137 minutes (no pun intended). And director Joseph Kosinski can stage action while providing a stellar attention to detail (love those gadget zoom and POV shots). But if you're looking for nostalgia and dramatic heft a la Tony Scott's sun-soaked vision, don't look here. What's worse, you don't know who the enemies are that the pilots are fighting in \"Maverick\". The aerial, high-flying stuff is just for show and for well, \"whoa\".Top Gun: Maverick is its own movie but it shouldn't force you to forget what transpired effectively 36 years ago. The original Top Gun was (and is) a pop culture artifact, a time capsule put forth, and nearly the first of its kind. \"Maverick\" lacks Top Gun's revered characters, its devil-may-care banter, and its two iconic endings. The late \"Mother\" Goose would abide.\n",

            "Title:  What The Cinematic Experience Is All About\n",
            "Review: In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to \"get out\" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.For a very basic overview, Maverick tells the story of the titular Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), still breaking in cutting-edge flying machines with no designs on sitting behind a desk. But in a world that has perhaps moved on from his ways, Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to help train a new class--including one Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whose name may sound familiar to fans of the original 1986 effort--for a seemingly impossible mission. Along the way, he rekindles a relationship with an old flame (played by Jennifer Connelly) and comes to terms with some unfinished business--both emotionally and in the skies.First and foremost, TG: Maverick is a 10/10 film--and easily, at that--because it perfectly balances the \"new stuff\" with the legacy material. Five minutes in, I knew that Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski had the right formula. There is not a single wasted or boring moment here. Not only that, but the focus is squarely on Cruise's Maverick pretty much throughout (as the title might suggest). This isn't some cheap handoff to a \"new crew\" with Cruise shepherding the transition. This is a down-and-dirty, perfectly planned out melding of old and new.Cinematically, I can count on one hand (if that) the number of times I've been as enthralled from a theater seat. The phrase \"see it on the biggest screen possible\" might be bit trite, but in this case it couldn't ring more true (I saw it in IMAX format and was completely blown away!). The cinematography is one-of-a-kind, the sound reverberates through the entire theater, and the drama/laughs are palpable throughout. I can definitively state--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that seeing TGM in a theater is better than any home theater setup imaginable. It simply was created for the theater experience.A final movie-specific observation: the ability of this film to garner tears, laughs, and thrills in equal measure is nearly unparalleled. Everything it does--from re-introducing a legacy character hero, to the airborne theatrics, to the subtle or romantic character work--is crafted with incredible care and precision. There is something here for everyone (another cinema hallmark, come to think of it).It is easy--and sometimes popular--to write off Cruise's work due to some of his personal foibles. At this point, however, one does that at his/her own risk. Is he now the greatest cinematic star of all time? Unanswerable question, of course, but Top Gun: Maverick puts him in the conversation, to be sure. Without his dogged persistence in making sure this flick wasn't unceremoniously dumped onto a streaming platform, who knows what may have become of it (through all the delays and hand-wringing).Movies like this one definitively prove that the experience remains viable in the current entertainment environment (both for quality and money-making ability). The future of cinema is still murky, to be sure, but as Maverick himself intones about his supposedly impending extinction: \"Maybe so, sir...but not today\".\n",

Top Gun: Maverick is definitely no exception to that. In fact, I don't think I've ever felt Tom's passion for filmmaking more intensely than I have after watching this movie. I can also tell through the performances of his supporting cast that he expects that same energy and commitment from them. I've never been more empathetic of the characters in a movie than this one. From the sense of brotherhood from the beach football scene and Mavierick's visit to Iceman to the intense feelings of duty, fear, anxiety, and hope during the team's mission, Top Gun: Maverick never ceased to make me care about the characters. I almost felt like I was there with them. I can't remember the last time I had this kind of experience.

            "Review: This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone as Tom Cruise turns in yet another winner. The man just can't lose, and anyone who's been following Tom throughout his career knows that Tom almost always delivers. Why? Because he knows a good story, and he also knows what the audience wants.And I also want to thank Tom Cruise for insisting that there be no CGI effects for the flying sequences. I don't even want to imagine how this movie would lhave ooked had they used CGI. Too many movies these days rely too heavily on them. It was said that after seeing this film, you would feel as though you'd sat in the cockpit yourself. This is no lie.Maverick is back and up to his old tricks. He still isn't the most beloved pilot in the Navy. In fact, he's pretty much the opposite. You still have a hotshot pilot who pushes the envelope, both inside and outside of the cockpit.On the verge of never flying a plane again, Maverick is asked to teach the best-of-the-best, to prepare them for an absolutely harrowing mission that requires the best-of-the-best to even have a hope of completing it. If you thought the flying sequences were spectacular in the first one--and they were!--you ain't seen nothing yet! In this regard, at least, the film was not overhyped!Maverick has new trials to deal with: how to teach a new generation of hotshot pilots and get them to act as a team. The mission requires absolute precision. He also has to deal with the fallout with Rooster, Goose's son. And believe it or not, there's a lot more it than Goose's death. And lastly, Maverick has to find a way to prove to the top brass that--while he seems like he's asking for the impossible--what he's demanding is actually possible.The film is wrought with heart, emotion, and inspiration. Nothing is over-the-top, and there are even a few curveballs that you probably won't expect.We also have a good cast of young pilots, with Hangman, Phoenix (an inspiration to women everywhere!), Payback, Bob, and Fanboy, and Coyote. While the first film had more humor than this one, especially the banter between fellow pilots, this one is just as long on men and women dedicated and masters at their craft.The music of Hans Zimmer, Harold Faltermeyer, and Lady Gaga (who also helped compose the music as well) is certainly memorable and effective. And anyone who fell in love with the original Top Gun's opening sequence, will certainly not feel cheated or disappointed with this one!There are just enough references and momentous nods to the original without becoming overloaded or melodramatic. This Top Gun is telling its own story, and there aren't too many parallels between the first film and this one.I'm glad it took 36 years for them to get this sequel to us, as long as they did it right. And boy, did they EVER do it right! When it comes to films, there is only one bonafide mega-Hollywood superstar left. And everyone knows how that is! And he more than delivers once again.\n",

            "Review: This is definitely a film that everyone has to watch. The film features intense action and emotional scenes. The whole movie is basically like a rollercoaster!!! The movie brought you back to where it all started, the music, the scenes... You'll find so much classic scenes that make you think about the first film. The dogfight scenes and Maverick flew solo are just sooooooo damn realistic and fantastic. The interaction between Mav and the young top gun pilots is dramatic! It is definitely a film that you should watch it twice!!!!!!!!!!\n",

            "Review: The sequel revolves around Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell being brought back to Top Gun flight school to teach pilots on flying a secret mission to take out a soon to be nuclear base somewhere in a rocky moutainess terrain. The flight scenes are truly amazing, there were moments I was on the edge of my seat. Tom Cruise is pure perfection, he is Maverick personified. That smile, those rugged good looks and that natural talent is electrifying. This man is pushing 60 and is clearly at the top of his game. Bringing in Miles Teller as the son of Goose was genius. The relationship between them is contentious at first but the end result is well worth it. It was awesome to see Val Kilmer again, so touching to see him. That was one of the top moments in the movie. I also loved Jennifer Connlley as Penny, she is always wonderful and her chemistry with Tom Cruise is a great match.This movie was amazing... totally worth the wait. I was 16 years old when I saw the original on the big screen and I have forever been a hard core Tom Cruise fan. The original takes you back to a time where patriotism was celebrated and you knew we loved our country. Ahhh nostalgic good times. Well this film takes you back there too even though it is +35 later, the film takes us to a good place and it felt good to watch. For those 2 hours it was pure goodness. A sigh of relief that I didn't feel lectured about what I should feel or do, I wish every movie could be this refreshing. This is a movie I plan to watch in the theaters a few times. Thank you Top Gun Maverick... for giving us Americans what we have been hungering for!\n",

            "Title:  The epitome of American military forces pathos, but highly entertaining at the same time\n",
            "Review: \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is an American, no THE American, movie from 2022 and this one runs for minimally over two hours if we don't count closing credits as you can add another ten minutes for those. The director is Joseph Kosinski and this is not the first time he has worked with lead actor Tom Cruise, but we will get a little later to cast and characters. In any case, Kosinski is not new to filmmaking, but also not extremely experienced. He has worked on a few films that also include American hero characters since his breakthrough in 2010, so him being picked for this one kinda makes sense. The key writer is Peter Craig. He is maybe the bigger name with his involvement with the Hunger Games franchise, the newest Batman movie and also The Town, maybe the best he has come up with so far. In any case, the parallel between him and Kosinski is that they both had their big breakthrough ten years into the new millennium. There are two other writers credited and these come from the original Top Gun movie from 35 years ago approximately. You can check their names if you like. One of them is still alive and I wonder what he thinks about the quality of this new film and if the high praise it has received so far is justified. Director Tony Scott died about a decade ago and you can read his name also at the end of the film. A few more words on the crew you could say here, namely on the music department: The names Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga in the same movie sure make for something unique. I must say I am not a Gaga fan though and her song towards the end also did almost nothing for me. We will see if she can score another Oscar nomination with it. I hope not. So yeah, for me as a German, there is surely more focus on the two Germans I have just mentioned. Now, let's look at the cast: It really from beginning to end all about Tom Cruise. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly plays the love interest. Miles Teller (Whiplash) plays the protagonist's former wingman's son. Mad Men's Jon Hamm plays the closest to an antagonist. Val Kilmer is I think the only one (except Cruise of course) who reprises his role from the old film and he looks a lot like Jon Voight here. No Meg Ryan. There's others. Of course here you can also check out the list yourself if you care.As for the film, I am not sure I have ever seen more American pathos in one movie. The consequence was unfortunately that pretty much every single character felt fairly stereotypical. And yet, somehow it all went right. I would not agree with the raving reviews or extremely high average ratings, but I was genuinely entertained here from beginning to end. I mean I am probably biased because I like most of the cast members. Huge fan of Cruise, his personal life is none of my business. Miles Teller is one of the younger actors I really like and Jon Hamm is always a joy to watch. Simply love Mad Men. But also the ones playing smaller characters are totally fine. Glen Powell is the best example. He seemed so familiar, but maybe it is just the face. I could not really say where I saw him before. There was also the possibility his character could end up as an antagonist, but eventually the opposite is the case. Maybe the coolest moment of the film when he shows up to save the two more central male characters and what he says there. And it fits. It is all about how people in the military stick together and they are really one team, one unit, so they could not have one of them become a true antagonist or so. If you can maybe criticize the characters, then it refers to the female characters. Not a great deal of depth to them. This applies to Connolly's role for sure, but maybe also to Monica Barbaro's character, even if she is super easy on the eyes. Then again, she is just one of the military characters that do not get a lot of screen time and even less elaboration. Despite making the cut. Most of the time, she is just there to admire Cruise's character. Admittedly, to move a bit away from the gender talk, you can also say that Bob does not have too much screen time either. He just creates laughs when he is introduced with his military (non-)nickname. Just like some others when they initially do not know yet who it is they are carrying out of the bar. Next day, the rude awakening happens. Oh yeah, Barbaro's character also had that moment when Hangman is criticized for being anti-female, another reference where you could think he is maybe a bad guy, but he is just cocky and that's it and also some of the others do not like him as much as Teller's character for sure. They want the latter to be their team leader.I do agree with those saying that perhaps the last half hour is the highlight here. They kept the mission pretty simple. Early on, it still seems almost like a casting show, but this is not what it gets to be about. Eventually, the focus is on the mission itself: What they have to do exactly, namely hit two precision shots from up above to destroy radioactive substance belonging to the enemy. At the same time, they do not only have to make the shots, but also be very quick and get out safely afterwards. This is emphasized especially on one occasion when Cruise's character (the film is fittingly named after him) talks to Hamm's. Oh and by the way, the enemy is not explicitly stated. They are called a rogue state or rogue nation and that is it. We do not see the bad guys' faces either. The one thing we do know is that it is rather cold in said country. Honi soit qui mal y pense. If you know what I mean with politic events in 2022. Okay, the film was made before that and let's not get into detail on this now. Focus on the film instead. What we must get into detail on is how gimmicky this film felt at times and how it was almost too much and sometimes crossing the fine line between being entertaining and being simply over-the-top. This applies to almost everything involving Connelly's character. How we literally see her fall for him. How her daughter tells Cruise's character not to hurt her again. That was maybe the funniest moment from the film when she sees him there jumping from her mother's window. The words he tells Connelly's character one one occasion were also fairly gooey.There are more scenes that did feel on the awkward side. I mean I like Cruise, but people who don't could really struggle here. Also when Hamm looks at him in the end and finally accepts his greatness. How Kilmer's character dies on one occasion. How Maverick at the beach makes sure the gang becomes a team and shows us his great topless body as well and that he is easily in strong enough shape to take on these youngsters. Like he did before during the training. There are so many other moments. Of course, I must mention the scene in which Cruises's character pretty much loses his job and then shows everybody what he is capable of and that it is possible to get this mission done. In the process, he steals a priceless plane as well. Hamm's character's words there, his reaction was also so entertaining to watch, even if a bit exaggerated, but he made the most of it. The actor I mean. And was there ever any doubt that Cruise's character would fly the mission himself and not just be a teacher? Probably not. I mean I had some doubt if he would make it out alive in the end. Everybody knew the mission would be a success and also that Teller's character would live, but you could always think Cruise's Maverick would die a hero here. Eventually, he did not. It happened in another big franchise recently and that was enough, so good that they let the guy at the center live this time.I must also totally mention the flight sequences. They are nothing short of spectacular and the heart and soul of the film. Of course, the landscapes with all the snow are a true highlight towards the end, but also what they called the dogfight in the end with the evil pilot guy was a true highlight. This they had to use to really show that it is all about the pilot when it comes down to man versus man and not about the (potentially inferior) plane. Also pay attention to the recurring idea of \"Don't think. Just do.\" This was also quite on the edge between cool and too much. But it's all good I'd say. Just like when Mach 10 extremely early on wasn't enough yet for Maverick. But I take it with the \"Where am I?\" \"Earth.\" quote. That was hilarious. Maverick surely survives really many of these critical situations up in the air with his plane coming down fast. The drama coming from flocking birds or characters losing consciousness because an elephant is metaphorically sitting on their chest was nice entertainment too for sure. Surely, a lot more I could mention. Oh yes, Ed Harris in the prologue. How could I forget about him!? I also think they established some nice ties to the original movie. Good job there. I suggest watching that one right before you see this one here. But it is not a must-do of course. You will nicely understand the story in here as well without even having heard of the film from the 80s. Not a requirement to know or have seen that one. So yeah, I give \"Top Gun: Maverick\" surely a thumbs-up and to be honest I almost felt myself at some point as if I was sitting in a flight simulator because the cockpit scenes were so convincing. By the way, could one say anything negative about this film when Cruise himself shows up at the world premiere in a helicopted he flew himself? Doubtful. Coolest guy ever. And right man for the role. Do not miss out on this quality film before it disappears from movie theaters. At home, it will not be half as spectacular, even if admittedly you can play a little drinking game with your friends where one has to take a shot for each cringeworthy moment and you will be pretty drunk when it's over. Not gonna lie. With this film, you get what you came for.\n",

            "Review: To be honest, this is not a difficult sequel to be filmed. Prepare a cool air force mission, add a bit of nostalgia, some teaspoons of dalliance, bromance, inheritance, and sprinkle the whole thing with naked Tom Cruise - there you have it, Top Gun: Maverick.The action scenes are sublime, whether stunts, cinematography, or pacing, all flawless. With spot-on camera work, every turn and climb of the planes tightly steers the audience's heart. On top of that, Tom Cruise utilizes his Mission-Impossible-ish valor to further increase the intensity, making every gunshot more soul-stirring, and every cheer more convincing. Also used in the prequel, the golden color layout provides reminiscence and warmth, which contrasts directly with the white snow of the final battle. Just for the bombards and dogfight, the movie is at its summit.However, despite the hot-bloodedness, there are a few confusing aspects. Penny was never introduced in the prequel, nor is she relevant to the Top Gun community before Pete's arrival, making her existence serve nothing but a scripted, unnecessary relationship. Furthermore, the last part when the protagonists steal enemy aircraft is just too dramatic to be real.Other than these minor issues, the film is spotless. Distinct two-line narrative, solid storyline, and perfect display of air fights that excel the prequel. Definitely an ideal sequel.\n",

I think there isn't much creativity here, but the film rather relies on the theatrics and special effects of the real life US Navy pilots, who did an awesome job, in saving the movie. If you've seen the original you've seen the sequel. I believe much of the high ratings are a result of the \"bandwagon effect\" as well as the excellent marketing of the studios that made the movie. Sequels should never be made.\n",

            "Review: You cant say this about many movies, but this is a fantastic sequel. It flowed nicely and the cinematography was top tier. If you have the chance to watch it in a Dobly or IMAC theater definitely do it. You can feel the intensity as if you are actually there. The story was well thought out with many references from the first movie. I also very much appreciate how it was filmed. Truly an awesome experience. Definitely recommend as a must watch.\n",

            "Review: The movie is perfectly filmed etc and I would give it 10/10 if it actually ended when maverick did his duty. After that point it goes into silly Hollywood usa-invincible logic just to make a third top gun movie in 20 years with maverick in it as the first captain-admiral... So (10/10 + 8/10) /2 = 9/10.\n",

Brilliantly filmed, the jet scenes are breathtaking. Love the familiar faces, love the new ones. The plot wasn't too complex - it just worked and left that feel good feeling. Loved it.\n",

            "Review: I just watched the film and truly enjoyed it. It as engaging, old school action fun the way they don't make them anymore. Tom Cruise was born for this role. The supporting characters, everything was perfect, but the disease of too long endings stroke again. The film was perfectly set for Maverick to die an honorable death and get absolution, go out guns blazing, a dinosaur in AI era, take your pick. The whole movie was perfectly set for an epic death and absolution to the character. But then he lives, and he stole an F-14 taking off from a 50m runway, only to fight fighter jets 30 years more advanced than his. Anyway I don't mind the extravaganza, in the end that's what the character is all about, but it really felt like the movie was about to finish and some executive just ordered another 20 minutes because of the potential for more sequels. Especially now that it's smashing the box office. Nevertheless, great fun, highly recommended. 8/10.\n",

            "Review: Let's get this straight. Very few people are bigger fans of the original top gun than me, and I've waited decades for this sequel.But it is truly awful, which has really upset me.The plot is paper thin, with the mission ripped shamelessly from Star Wars.There is no explanation about the scramjet programme that Maverick was piloting before he presumably crashed it.There are no characters to love and no characters to hate.There is no explanation for Penny Benjamin being the love of Maverick's life, given all we know about her previously was one 'ballistic' incident in the 80s.There is precisely zero chemistry between Maverick and Benjamin.There is precisely no sense of camaraderie between the 'best of the best' that Maverick has to coach for the 'suicide mission'. Nor is there any real sense of competition amongst them, unlike the original where they were vying for the top gun trophy.The topless football game in the sea is a very poor rip off of the topless volleyball in the original.There is no enemy. The main danger comes from surface to air missiles.And finally, the shark is well and truly jumped when they steal a 40-year old F14 that is magically charged and fuelled, then take off from a runway they destroyed half an hour into the movie.Seriously, I could go on but I won't.Two stars for the aerial photography and the skill of the actually pilots, but there is nothing else to recommend here.Perhaps this is what the original would have been without the genius script that was actually about one man's struggle with his sexuality with a few aerial battles thrown in, rather than just a movie about fighter pilots.\n",

In addition, it's worth a ticket on promotion day.\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a Tom Cruise whim that even generates a bit of entertainment for an audience that doesn't bother with a typical action movie with a very shallow script, which looks like it came out of the work of average students of a cinema course with the theme \"Sequel Top Gun\".\n",

I've been waiting so long to see this movie, and now it's finally here. I liked it from the beginning to the end, good acting, a good script, good directing, good dialogue, and good music from Kenny Loggins to Lady Gaga. Awesome action scenes and it will leave a smile on your lips when you leave the cinema, and you will shed one or more tears. It will probably win many awards at the Oscars, and I will crown it one of the best films this year. I recommend this movie to everyone and you will like it highly.

            "Review: Tom Cruise (Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell) appears in just about every scene, but he delivers the goods.After disgracing himself by destroying a test plane, he is reassigned to train elite fighter jet pilots for a near impossible mission. The enemy is never named but think secret nuclear facility and you can probably complete the picture.The young pilots are cocky and dismissive of their ancient teacher, but Maverick quickly earns their respect with a mix of testosterone and flying skill. One of them is the son of Maverick's old Wingman, who died in the first movie. The strained relationship between the two and the build up to the final few scenes is a major subplot of the movie.The two hour 14 minute time flew by (literally) with edge of the seat excitement and stunning visuals. Make sure you watch it on a big screen.\n",

Right up to the 3 foot opening of the vent shaft at the end of a narrow corridor they need to fly through. I swear, in one scene as they were entering the canyon, they cgi'd an actual x-wing in for a few milliseconds as they were banking left. The \"enemy\" pilots even looked a lot like tie fighter pilots. Still, a good movie to watch but come on lmao.\n",

Haven't been on a high after exiting the cinema for ages, but this was just right.Action, just enough comedy, emotional, enough links to the original for us who saw it the first time to re-play the original soundtrack (which is the only thing better about the first time round).\n",

            "Review: Worth a view on the big screen for the action scenes but boy were things predictable.Cruise was his usual charismatic self, but let down by a cliche-ridden script that felt like it had been written by AI as well as some lukewarm support.Continuity errors and plot flaws were many, which is a shame and unnecessary when you consider the budget.Worth a trip to see on the big screen for state of the art special effects, but I'd have hate to have sat through it at home where a decent plot is more important.\n",

This however did not disappoint... the action, characters, cinematography, script was all brilliant and with great homage to the original. I read about Val kilmers story asking to be in this, and the reluctance due to his personal medical conditions, but I'm glad the producers agreed... as even his small part was very enjoyably moving. I left the cinema completely buzzing.... At this outstanding movie.\n",

Every minute in they spent up in the air with those fighter jet sequences are magnificent and must be experienced in Big screen and it will give u a roller coaster like adrenaline tight experience.Now I don't live in US.. so the patriotic all americana tingle didn't connect to me. This movie was oozing with ray ban commercial (no pun intended) vibe through out especially in the middle part. And the most important thing this was such a dude kinda movie. My wife who is also not american and doesn't care about fighter jets , the movie offered her nothing expect for Tom Cruise. The enemy threat didn't actually felt very threatening. The whole cast has very little to do. There were these top pilots but in the 3rd act, we forget about everyone expect for Miles Teller.\n",

So poignant to have Vil Kilmar and Tom Cruise characters meeting as older men - this scene had me in floods of tears as it mirrors real life to a large extent. The soundtrack is exhilarating and nostalgic - loving the Lady Gaga contribution too. The dog fight scenes were so realistic my tummy was turning over. Watched it on big screen - think that's a must. A sequel that wasn't really needed but we are all so glad is here- a masterpiece.\n",

There are some cliche characters and expected plot twists but acting and chemistery save it all. I can't complain for cliche dramatic character arcs. TopGun Maverick is all about crazy fun and thrilling action.You shouldn't miss this one if you like classics because this one is already a classic! 8/10.\n",

So we instead to see Top Gun instead. And boy did we made the right decision. It was the best cinema experience I had in a long time. The story has so much heart and it keeps us glued to our seats with incredible Cinematography and a Score that is out of this world (Courtesy of Hans Zimmer). The fighter jet scenes were unbelievably awesome. Tom Cruise delivered above and beyond for this movie. I heard a quote somewhere that Tom Cruise maybe the last real movie star we have. Every character in the movie was unique and not one of them felt out of place. Tom Cruise is a living legend and we are so lucky to have a superstar like him in our life time.After watching the movie, my girlfriend who didn't know anything about Top Gun before said \"Thank God that the Doctor Strange show was sold out\"\n",

            "Review: Pros effects were amazing, revisiting some \"old friends\" and finding out how their stories progressed, fun scenes, great action sequences.Cons pretty thin plot, undeveloped characters, just a little to formulaic for me. So many of the scenes were lifted right out of the first one and so little was added that I didnt feel like I was watching a Sequel so much as a remake. Tom's still out racing jets on his motorcycle, being a rebel, and daring to do what no one else can. But ultimately they take zero chances with this version of Top Gun preferring to stick to script and for that it's hard for me to rate it any higher.I do like to think Penny is \"Penny the admiral's daughter\" from the first Top Gun. Maybe that's a nod to the nostalgia I felt for seeing the Top Gun story being dusted off after so many years. If you are going to dismiss McGillis' character with zero fanfare then I would hope her replacement was waiting in the shadows so she has some connection to original.Ultimately a feel good movie that looks even better than the first, comes close to capturing the same magic, but like most imitations just isn't as good.\n",

            "Review: I've been waiting for this sequel for such a long time. I consider Top Gun as a never fading classic, a true masterpiece that will go through the challenge of time. So Maverick has huge shoes to fill and the shoes got filled alright!First, this movie breathes nostalgia especially regarding the brotherly relationship Maverick had with Goose. After all those years, Maverick hasn't still completely moved on from the tragic death of his best friend. It still haunts him to the high point especially now that Goose's son, Rooster, is following his dad steps and became one of the top pilots in the navy. The story between Maverick and Rooster is so rocky it breaks your heart as Rooster believes Maverick is preventing him from achieving his true potential while all Maverick wants is to protect him and be the father Rooster lost too early.Then you have the come-back of Iceman who has moved up to the ranks and became the commander of the US Pacific Fleet as a full fledged admiral. He has become Maverick best friend and has been using his position to protect him and keep him in the navy as he believes that the Navy needs Maverick. Watching Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise interacting with each other so sweetly and still joking around about who is the best pilot can't stop bring you a smile. It also breaks your heart when Iceman finally passes away as you cry along with Tom Cruise as he buries his wingman.Finally there is the F-14. The cherry of the top as we see Maverick and Rooster in one last epic dogfight taking on 2 Su-57 in this mighty aircraft. That scene alone is a blast, keeps you out of breath every second as it's so intense and breathtaking. The F-14 is still as gracious as it can be and that plane still can fly.Of course the F-18 is also as majestic. What a beautiful plane that is. I'm glad they picked that plane instead of the F-35 which is not as gracious on camera. I believe it would have taken a lot of magic off the movie if it was the F-35 on screen instead of the F-18.Finally I have to give one last special mention to Lady Gaga for her amazing song. I love it so much and it gives such a powerful ending to the movie with the P-51 flying around in the sunset. Such a raw talent she is.\n",

The past was given tribute without being heavy-handed, the new characters shined without overshadowing the legacy characters, the story was intense and emotional, and the action scenes were unparalleled. Every self-respecting moviegoer must see this film, and do so as soon as possible.\n",

            "Review: Definitely the movie I was hoping to watch in a last few years! Worth waiting and watch it on the Big Screen! The first movie in theory didn't need any sequel, but the job was so well done that the sequel was definitely better than the first one after 30 years gap! For sure the best movie in the last years! Congratulations to all those who were involved in this project!\n",

            "Review: The second episode after 36 years! (Is it a record?)Tom is still handsome and charming! He was employed by Top Gun again to train the pilots imcluding son of goose (Miles really look like goose anyway) The fighting scenes are so exciting and real, and realize Tom is really flying but not using green screens! Surprising Val is involved though minimal, and Jennifer is still pretty! The last scene where they fight using F14 really amazed me, and love Miles saying 'Dun think otherwise you're dead!' Hope can watch again soon!\n",

I can say that this was one of the best decisions I could have made, the second movie is already fantastic on its own, but having all the references so fresh in my memory made me enjoy it to the fullest.So even if you've seen the first one at some point in your life, take this advice and you won't regret it.\n",

Cruise's performance has increased in emotional depth and perception. Provides all the thrilling action and intense dogfights as expected, but still is plenty of weighty subject matter.Spectacular film, couldn't have been better.\n",

            "Review: I can understand why this movie is so popular in the United States, an audience that the accustomed to Marvel, Disney World and a lot of artificiality in their lives. I consider this movie to be about a 6, it was entertaining if you didn't think about it too much.The performances were decent but nothing really stood out, there was not a single performance that stood out, everybody did an adequate job. I must confess to never understanding why Joe Hamm is a celebrity or has the tiniest bit of fame, that's one issue I had with the film. There were a couple of characters that were pretty annoying, none of the characters were well-developed, the writing seemed pretty poor, and on the juvenile side, and Tom Cruise's performance was about on par with everyone else. Adequate, but nothing special, just adequate. I would describe this entire movie as nothing special, just adequate.The best parts were the aerial scenes, but I don't understand why this film is considered special. It was just adequate. The direction, the score, and the performances were good enough. The two performances that stood out for me, were Miles Teller (as usual) and a brief cameo by Val Kilmer, and the cinematography and production were very good.\n",

            "Review: My number rating is a bit lower than others I am seeing here, but don't get me wrong- I REALLY enjoyed this movie. It was a blast, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The cast does an excellent job, and I was touched by the care they took with it, particularly the scene between old friends (you will know the one when you see it), which I did not expect at all.The downsides to this film are 2. First, in many ways it is beat-for-beat of the original. That's understandable, but a little bit of a disappointment. In particular, one of the headscratchers of the original is that it portrays an international incident with no consequences. So does this one. It's fun though, so I guess it's ok.The bigger downside is the timeline. Goose's son in the original is my age and would be about 40 now (38 had it released on time). He could easily be a Navy captain in his own right by that age, or at least a CAG. The explanation that Mav somehow held up his papers in the academy for 4 years both doesn't suffice and doesn't hold much water. Unfortunately, that realization takes me out of it a bit.On the other hand, the real strength of the film is Tom Cruise's portrayal of Maverick. In the original, Maverick is arguably the closest thing to a villain. Ice constantly says he's dangerous, and he proves that, and his inability to follow rules, over and over. He puts people at total unnecessary risk. In this film, he still takes massive risks, but he does so in order to better his team. He's learned how to be a team player, and more than that, a leader and teacher who really does care about the people around him. The level of maturity and responsibility (and feeling) that Cruise portrays here is the movie's greatest strength.See it in theaters. It's meant to be a spectacle, and it's a great one as long as you don't think too hard about it.\n",

He does something for a few minutes in that movie that's just worth an IMAX ticket alone. It's not just about action. Top Gun Maverick keeps things simple and on the deeper side it's about human mortality, guilt and letting go. What a movie. Made me great to be alive.\n",

            "Review: Heart pumping, eye popping adrenaline rush. Sit back and just let yourself be entertained by this spectacular movie. It was worth the wait. Easily one of the best action movies of the year, let alone the last years. To be fair though, the movie is more than an action movie. That would not do it justice. Tom Cruise fits the role like the jacket he wears in the movie. The guy is just that good in his role as Maverick.The filming in the cockpit of the F-18 is beyond mind boggling. You really start to appreciate what these pilots can do in these planes. The way they went about filming this in the way they did, is a true testament to how committed the producers were in getting this just right for the audience to see. For my wife and I it was a great night out. Fully entertained. Go see it....it's good.\n",

            "Review: I must have watched the original Top Gun about 30 times....and allthough that was and is an awesome movie, this one is much better, much more realistic and the fact this has been done mainly with practical effects (not too sure about that one move from that *non Russian* plane) is mindblowing - you really feel as if you're watching real fighter pilots.... Mr Cruise was absolutely right getting all the actors real life experience and camera time in those fighter jets, pulling real G's....hell, a dream for many non-actors as well of course.I watched this movie in 4dx (moving seats - felt like a roller coaster - air and water features) which made it even more immersive....will watch it again (in 4dx of course) for sure....this cinematography is a grasp for us normal people to experience what it is to be in one of those majestic supersonic, g-force bringing beasts.Only thing I was wondering about....why F18's....while the 'enemy' is rocking US made better planes (I know the F35's were not available at the time and they needed planes with dual seats, but this was not what the US would do imho lol)\n",
            "Also...5th and 4th generation planes? Call them by their names guys....everyone knows an F22, an F35, an F18 of F14...Not minding that too much...awesome movie, awesome dogfighting scenes (and not twice the same scene as in the original one with the planes twirling about), very realistic when it comes to the flying (not the mission of course) and good acting.... I will probably watch this more than the 30 times I watched the original one....4k and Dolby Digital or THX sound would be great.\n",

            "And actually is exactly that but I underestimated a couple of things. First I underestimated the level of quality that was put into the making of this movie, they simply did two times the extra mile on every freaking detail from video to audio down to the technical details secondly I underestimated the hard work of Tom and all the other actors, deamn Tom you blew me off my sox what a performance at your age I salute you! And third I underestimated myself and the emotional attachment to the whole topgun thing... I took 3 minutes to get me in tears. Yes this is a very emotional movie for dudes lol I warned you. This was what i was waiting for THANK YOU.\n",

            "Review: I regrettably arrived about 20 minutes late due to transport issues and Maverick was speeding on his motorbike next to a jet taking off. This seemed like a good intro on its own, but I'll probably have to go back and see what I missed.I went for IMAX, a few seats up from the front and it felt like you were right in the movie. Really awesome action, plot, dialogue, cinematography, sound effects, action scenes, the flight scenes, combat and dog fighting were amazing. I will go back for a rewatch I think. I had been waiting for this movie for ages but it kept getting delayed due to Covid. However it looks like they've used this time well to polish it up into the masterpiece it is.I am sure they used F/A-18s because none of the US's 5th gen fighters (F-22 or F-35) can take front and back seat pilots. Without the back seats there would be no film because the actors weren't allowed to pilot the real planes. However for someone with knowledge of fighter aircraft it seemed like it was shoehorned into the movie. Also the old F-14 was shoehorned as a throwback to the old Top Gun movies, but it was unrealistic because how did the Russians get a hold of one in the first place, also it would not reasonably have taken out so many 5th gen Su-57s. So some unbelievable aspects there. I think if there is another Top Gun sequel, maybe they can train real Airforce or Navy F-22 or F-35 fighter pilots to be actors, rather than actors to be Top Gun pilots. Food for thought. However Cruise can fly a plane for real and I want him in the sequel so he needs to be trained to fly these 5th gen fighters as well.\n",

            "Review: The original was great. I'm an 80's kid and loved the original. This was a boring, jumbled mess. There was Zero character development. Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly didn't make much sense. They went from not seeing each other for 30 years to being in love in 1 scene.The generic mission with a generic enemy was lacking. I didn't care about the mission or the enemy.Mike's Teller was decent, but the rest of the cast was just their to make TC look better. But it's not there fault their was no plot.It was good to see Val Kilmer, but also sad to know this aweful movie will be his last.It you can make it until the last 20 minutes, the final sequence is fairly entertaining. But not worth sitting through the first 90 minutes of boring.\n",

He is to prepare a squad of young men and women for a mission.This is the prelude to a film about cohesion, commitment to each other, overcoming one's own limitations and equally recognizing them, even if one has run away from them for years.Without saying too much about the plot, this film offers breathtaking aerial combat action almost throughout and yet remains believable for the most part. It's a difficult balancing act, but one that the cast and crew manage very well throughout the entire running time. A great performance, especially when you know the flying scenes are real.I've been interested in the subject of civilian and military flight for a while now, play the corresponding video games, and have often found myself wanting to take the controls...\n",

            "Review: It's Saturday night and its Tom Cruise times. A smartest looking hero who would hit 60 this year just before US Independence is out here flying all over the SKYreen Cruising on Top in his most stylish and energetic look . The expectations on TOP GUN was way too high considering it to be a sequel for the one that got released 36 years ago. The plot is quite understandable and easily guessable. Unlike many other sequels this sequel doesn't mandate any one to see the first part. For me the movie looked so much straight fwd and ended too soon . TOP GUN is definitely a Grandeur and a must see in IMAX for all the visuals with some great re-recording. The VFX and screenplay was TOP NOTCH and was quite exhilarating. The style and the class of Tommy's acting just didn't drop a bit . It takes very little effort for Tom Cruise to handle jet flights since he's been flying in real for quite a while now with real pilot licence . Val Kilmer , Jeniffer Connelly and many others extend their best performance to make this movie quite enjoyable .\n",

            "Review: To begin this is probably one of or THE best movie of the decade until now, but as a great movie it isn't perfect but firstable let's begin for the good stuff:TOM CRUISE is an actor who is impossible to say is a bad actor and this proves it, it's amazing how this man being old as he is does this work really great, no one old as he is would do this work as he did it, the balls he had to have to do this performance it's admirable, i think he should got insured his Oscar.JOSEPH KOSINSKI deserves without any doubt the Oscar for being the best director of this year, it's an object for study how he directed this masterpiece, how complex are the cinematografic shots, the control and the passion he should have to control all of this huge staff what is even more the quantity of planes there are, believe me when i say the direction is the best this movies's got.Jennifer Connely did a good performance, it's great to see her in a movie again but being honest i don't think so she will win her second oscar, is a great performance but is incomparable to her performance in \"A beautiful mind\" it's possible she could be nominated but nothing else more to expect there's yet a big left of the year so it's obviusly there wil be more options.One of the things that makes this movie good is watch old staff from original movie which it's gotta be cherish and that's what makes this movie a great sequel, it keeps some songs from original movie, but i will regard that part later. It has to be take in care that there's no one who was a bad actor everybody was great in this moment but not perfect as Tom was.Music here fits as a great soundtrack has to do it, every music you listen on this movie goes perfectly with each scene chosen anyway let's remenber part of this great work was made by Lady Gaga who i don't think will win the Oscar because there's left Elvis movie wich obviusly has to have a great soundtrack however if this movie results has a poor soundtrack the clearly winner is Lady Gaga.Getting back to the direction every scene of planes is perfect but clearly stands out the training scene and the final battle where we can see how it plays with the people's strain and by part of the training scene it's the firts scene we see and wich starts to introduce this prefect work of direction.But as i said not everything is perfect in this movie like de history.Dont misunderstand me the history isn't bad, final's really good i'd say is a 8/10, beginning from the good side this movie started good and it ended AMAZING but the history isn't a marterpiece in fact to be honest is an easy script it's just about how Maverick becomes teacher and how he's gotta steer a team at the final to just destroy a military base is a bit lazy history it'd be great have a deeper script and dialogues, i repeat it's not a bad history it can be better; it's a 6.8/10 for the history.And to finish the final is beautiful but the final battle more when you think Maverick'd have died, no it really obviusly he won't and just try to give a intrigue moment but it isn't so severe it's okay in fact.Anyway no one of these \"bad moments\" it's enough to say this's a bad movie, no, and is what we're in front of a masterpiece gentlemen.Simply is a perfect work of direction and how a movie can make people feel like, and that's what makes great a movie the fact of make feel people this way with those shots. The best movie of the 2022 and i bet it's insured 9.4/10.\n",

The cast was amazing and it kept you off your seat the whole time!! I cried and laughed and got super nervous!! All the emotions that a film should bring !!! A++++ worth more than 10 stars !!\n",

            "Review: Top Gun is a fine example of movie making for the type saying if it's not broken don't fix it. I didn't get the exceptional rave reviews for the movie at first since the start and middle is basically a lot of training and nostalgia and if you are not into nostalgia based on first movie it's nothing exceptional despite the detailed training exercises. It's not a nonstop thrilling movie like the exceptional MI Fallout.Again like first movie role of the love interest serves no real purpose to Maverick as it hardly helps the story. Still it's sweetness and romance is bound to attract the female demo.Where the movie really kicks off is last climatic scene which is probably one of the best exciting action scenes ever done in a movie which will give you goosebumps and Tom Cruise is exceptional in it. It escalates the movie from a average movie to a very good movie and leaves you happy, entertained and satisfied. It's a movie that worships the hero and gives the happy ending he deserves going off to sunset with the girl beating the villains in a exciting spectacular fashion which shows you don't need to kill the hero or do something different to please audience. I'm looking at you No Time to Die which messed up badly trying to make Bond something he's not and ended up been worst divisive Bond movie in recent times.So let this be a good note to filmmakers that you can worship the hero and have a happy ending while giving a great movie as well. Top Gun Maverick is a movie that must be seen in theater for sure.\n",

            "Review: I expected a lot from the new movie. Yes it has its moments but most of the ideas are from the old original movie, like volleyball on the beach, goose's son singing on the bar.Fight sequences were very good. Patriotic is the movie. But does it surpass the original?Absolutely not. The guys who have written it surpasses the original do not even understand the first movie, which is a classic, which creates a legend, who creates a hero with a heart.Can't say too much but not disappointed but not at all impressed.\n",

I am 28 years old and have seen the original probably 10 times, I went into this movie with high expectations and left with my jaw on the floor.My gf and I saw it in IMAX on opening day and the visual effect was astounding. I've never seen a movie that realistic with such little CGI. I will be going back to see it again.As far as the story goes, it was good and actually made sense somehow. I liked the way they acknowledge that drones are taking over and digger pilots will be obsolete soon.There is one moment at the end that I thought was a little cheesy but otherwise the whole story was quite good. Also you have to love the opening scene on the aircraft carrier.\n",

            "Review: Top Gun: Maverick is one of the greatest sequels of all-time that somehow manages to top its legendary predecessor. The storyline is intricate keeping you hooked from the start. It has the perfect mix of fan service and originality from the original that leaves you giddy throughout the watch. I thought it was going to end a few times before it did and every event that occurred managed to shatter every expectation that I had going in. Every scene in this movie has a purpose and is perfectly proportioned. The acting is incredible, noting Tom Cruise and Miles Teller, but everyone else is truly outstanding as well. 9/10 at this current moment in time... It would've been a 10/10 if Take My Breath Away was played at some point. This is a MUST WATCH MOVIE.\n",

I enjoyed it- I went to the bathroom during the Iceman scene, which was probably a good thing, so I can't comment on that- BUT I will say I was expecting a bunch of young actors to overshadow the original story.... Which they totally did NOT. And for me that was the best part about this movie. I think it bridged the generation gap very well! I clapped at the end but nobody else did ... 😞 .... and sadly there is the generation gap right there!!\n",

Actually, an episode (Season 1, Episode 22) from the 12 O'clock High TV series has the same themes and was better done in my opinion.You might want to watch this movie if you saw the earlier one. Otherwise, stay home and watch the 12 O'clock High TV series.\n",

It's done properly and really natural sequel to the first film.Oh. And Jennifer Connelly is just ridiculously easy on the eye.Enjoy - we did. A 9/10 for the shameless need for speed.\n",

It's still cool, occasionally homoerotic and full of stunning flying, but now with a clearer goal and action scenes that can actually be followed.It takes the original's emotional core (Maverick's friendship with Goose and his relationship with Iceman) and develops it in extemely moving and satisfying ways, not only making for a great watch, but also making me appreciate the original a lot more.\n",

Tom Cruise did an amazing job he covered all the bases including the music. Coulda played \"danger zone\" during the mission but the silence added to the dramatic effect. This is definitely going to be taking a lot of awards. Keep bringing these types of movies back. Loved it and will see it again!!\n",

            "Review: Couldn't imagine a better first half to three-quarters of a movie. But true to form Hollywood went weird in the end. I came so close to leaving the theater happy as a clam, satisfied with a good movie sequel under my belt. But just like my overuse of cliches, Top Gun chose the dream over reality and a potential classic was lost. You can't help but notice the moment they crossed the line. It'll be the part where the six-year-old in them came out and filled the screen with every shiny, fluorescent, color in the box. In the end all the children will say \"great movie, dad!\" And all the adults will wonder where a 50+ year old man gets his hair dye and nerve to keep defying logic, making movies that are only believable to children.\n",

            "Review: Okay, it's Maverick so you'll see some things here that will make you say, yeah right. And let's just get away from the fact that the opening scene is from the movie The Right Stuff. And forget about the main theme being a total remake of the original Star Wars. It's got great action, it's light on the love story between the older and wiser Penny Benjamin but that's okay, it hits the right notes. The Iceman scene is great and touching. If you like the original you'll like this one. Is it better? Eh, maybe, but they are both high on action and this one was worth the 3 year wait. I finally got to see it and it was a really good movie worth the time and money. Go see it.\n",

            "Review: In the age of CGI and green screen cinematography, top gun II brings back old school filmmaking with stunts that are as real as it gets. The story and screenplay are kept clean to allow the flying sequences and action stunts to do most of the talking on the screen. All the supporting cast is near, precise and clean. The ending is really good and unexpected as you start thinking of different scenarios while the movie enters the climax sequence. I wish more actors and directors would go back to old school films where audience are not overdosed with CGI and chroma keying. If you loved top gun 1, I can guarantee that you will love this even more. I also think Tom Cruise will not do one more top gun in this lifetime.\n",

            "Review: Well, the original \"Top Gun\" was 50% watching fighter planes, 25% sound track, and 25% charismatic young performers. That sound track holds up, and Tom Cruise's career has held up almost as well. No new stars are likely to blossom from \"TG Maverick\"; there are brief pleasant moments with the well-established Jennifer Connelly (although her pasted-in character is nothing more than a flimsy attempt to provide a real human life for Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell), and Val Kilmer is all too plausible as an over-the-hill ex-hero. Not much else in the acting department--the movie is clearly 75% Tom Cruise. That leaves 25% for the flying this time and nothing for a forgettable sound track. Some viewers will miss Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan; I miss Kenny Loggins and Berlin. Cruise himself has lost a lot of his early brash appeal, but the weathered version has his own appeal. That and the zooming jets are about all there is to carry a movie that just doesn't have much reason to be made.\n",

            "Review: Ok, there are many elements that go into a movie. A great movie can be weak in certain areas if it is exceptional in others. What we, the viewer, look for in a movie is highly personal and subjective. Objectively Top Gun Maverick has the most amazing jet fighter action scenes ever filmed. The combination of incredible cinematography, tight editing and bombastic sound effects make these jet fighter action scenes absolutely visceral and riveting. The scene where Maverick successfully completes the near impossible training run in his F18E was among the best 10 minutes of cinema I have ever seen. I was totally gripped in my cinema seat. For this scene alone I give the movie 10 stars. Whilst I am sure some CGI was used in places (particularly the fictional Mach 10 spy plane in the opening scene), a large majority of what you see is real footage, either in cockpit, from aeriel vantage points, or land vantage points. Tom Cruise is great, again. The rest of the cast is very strong. The story is entirely predictable, but with a clear direction and purpose, and serves to move the movie from one incredible action scene to the next but with meaning. The characters are a little 2D, but have sensible arcs and growth that increase emotional investment. The original movie had great action scenes with iconically cheesy dialogue and beautiful cinematography and great direction. Top Gun Maverick has less cheesy and less memorable dialogue but still very humerous in places, beautiful cinematography throughout, INCREDIBLE action scenes and tight direction. Both movies blend a lot of fantasy with reality, but they are movies, not documentaries, so that's fine by me. Anyway, if you are remotely interested in the idea of a navy jet fighter action movie, watch this movie on IMAX. It will blow you away. Watching this movie was one of the most memorable and enthralling cinema experiences I have ever had. I can't even tell you what the run time was, it seemed like 5 minutes as the movie just flew by (pun intended).\n",

Every movie of his, is like a vacation you really desire to achieve in life like his stunts, his personality, his acting and a finisher in every movie that Hollywood definitely relies on. Well, I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise and I hope I meet him someday. What an awesome movie I've watched in 2022! Lucky to be a part of this day. This is the best movie this year for me no matter what.

I would love to go and see it in a 4DX cinema as that would be amazing.Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves the original movie I can't honestly remember how many times I have seen Top Gun it must be well over 100 times.\n",

However I was not impressed. The film was very good to me, but nothing special in the sense that it was the best film I have ever seen. Yesterday i went to watch Top Gun 2 and i can say that this part impressed me. Flying scenes are SICK. Next week I'm going to see it once again in 4DX. All recommendations.\n",

It could've been some typical 2022 female empowerment nonsense. Yet instead there's only one women which is the reality of the Air Force. Are there women? Sure. But NOT MANY. There's no forced messages here. Just pure fun. Seriously miss movies like this and bravo to Cruise for giving it to us again.\n",

            "Review: This was just such FUN! When I was leaving the cinema people were openly saying how good it was and I had to agree. Ok so large part of it don't make much sense, why do they have to attack with such a small force (in a scenario straight out of Star Wars), why not have the rest of the squadron perform flak suppression on the SAM sites? Lots of homages to the first film not to mention 'The Right Stuff' but had to admit was on the edge of my seat when Mav went to Mach 10. Great gag when he walks into the diner in his burnt flight suit and asks where he is only for the kid to reply \"Earth!\". I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch. Speaking of which that was the most emotional part of the film (far more so than all the daddy stuff), seeing Cruise and Kilmer together in a situation that wasn't too far from real life, I highly recommend everyone watch the documentary 'Val' although it is rather heart-breaking. So was it cheesy? Yes, very much so. But was it 2 hours of action, 1980s nostalgia and first rate entertainment? Yes and I would highly recommend it.\n",

            "Review: Maverick is a sequel that's better than the prequel. Maybe because of the passage of 36 years in between films, the second one has less glossy, more serious approach. The Cold war machismo was replaced by a more reflective (although no less action-oriented) attitude. Tom Cruise, playing the title character, has supplanted delovee3d here a nuanced performance. In Top Gun, he was preening. Here, he's acting. The differences relate also to the screenplay, with less testosterone and to the tone, that is more grounded.\n",

            "Review: I just came back from the Lido cinema here in Singapore, the same cinema that, in 1986, me and my classmates sat there, wide-eyed and amazed by Top Gun. Now, in 2022, with my family tow, we sat in the Lido again, seeing these these iconic words flash across the screen, that unstoppable rush of nostalgia gushes out with palpable force from the very first frame of Top Gun Maverick, and what a fantastic movie it has been! Gosh I have waited 36 years for this movie, and man, the wait has been worth it. This is one of the few rare sequels where it's better, no, make that way way better than the original. The people behind the movie, Jerry Bruckheimer, Joseph Kosinski, Tom Cruise et al have made this a labour of their love. Every scene, every shot and every interaction is masterfully woven with intricate care and detailed planning. The action sequences are top of their class, surpassing that of the original by a country mile. With the passing of time comes emotional maturity, and dear me, the emotional segments, especially that brief reunion scene between Maverick and Ice Man reaches deep into your memory and pulls out those bygone feelings which has been buried deep in your heart for so many years. For the first time in many years, I feel like 17 again.\n",

It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter.\n",

            "Review: When I first heard about this film I was skeptical, Hollywood hasn't done a good job of late and so I was concerned that this would be some agenda driven drivel but was pleasantly surprised. However, with that said, I was only further surprised when there was no agenda at all from beginning to end. It was incredible, Hollywood made an actual film again?! For Entertainment?! Wow. Bonkers.Never the less, this film was everything you should expect from a sequel so many years later. It offers interesting story from the original that didn't skew off into some absurd difference, it was as if they had this planned all along - maybe they did, just took this long to achieve it.Still the cinematography was on point, just like the original Top Gun, and the passing of a torch was successful here where it has failed in so many other Hollywood films. Why? Because it never once took a crap on the originals. It never once disgraced the fans, or the original films. Instead it was more like Logan in that it was also about getting too old to keep doing this, but having enough fight to still get in there and get it done. Well done to the crew of this film, on point in a film that could've gone so much worse.\n",

            "Review: As a 16 year old, watching the first Top Gun movie in 1986, it was memorable and enjoyable for all the right reasons. Watching the sequel 36 years later at 52, Maverick took me back to the feelings I had all those years ago, although this time more emotional and very nostalgic. A brilliant film and one I'll remember for the rest of my days. Thanks Tom!\n",

            "Review: Warning Some Spoilers.I walked out of the original movie way back when and never looked back. I couldn't stand Tom Cruise's character. I was dragged to this last night and kind of liked it. Cruise's cocky Maverick has been humbled over the decades which made him different. It was great to see Val Kilmer and recognizing his current health conditions, it was utilized in this portrayal. It was poignant.Okay, did anyone else see the similarities to Star Wars Episode IV? The mission was right out of the Death Star attack. The trench run and the target being only a few meters. The widened mentor who served with the dead father of the son who now needs to be trained and has some issues to overcome. The words of wisdom from the mentor that you think too much about it, just go with your feelings (Use the force Luke).\n",

It's a wonderful film and it brings me back to how movies are suppose to be made.I have a tremendous amount of respect for Tom Cruise.

Dripping with a purposeful nostalgia while connecting all of the dots, closing all the loops and giving nods to those who came before... TG:M does it all and more. Even as Cruise's production team has been under the pressure of the Mission Impossible Franchise, as it shows in the Third Act, you are left with a warm heart and a peace of mind while being behind enemy lines. The specific detail to cinematography and charismatic cast line up well to close out a franchise 30 years in the making.\n",

It throw overboard all my expectations.The visuals, the music, the actual amount of action, finally not a 2,5 hour movie with 20 minutes of action like nowadays movies. The plot itself was decent either, maybe sometimes it was a bit too sensitive for me, but it was good. I finally got what I wanted from a movie in the cinema. Thrill, entertainment, joy, jet fights, blasts, good fun.If you have 2,5 hour spare time in your life at the moment, you should definetily go and watch this in cinemas. You are not going to be disappointed. Especially if you are longing for some pure adrenaline action movie with some tenderness at some points. I really recommend it to everyone.\n",

            "Review: In the summer of 1986, a little movie called Top Gun came out of nowhwere and became a huge hit at the box ofice not only because of the director who helmed it but its star Tom Cruise. The film would soon see greater success as an album and home video release made it a big 80s fad that still airs to this day. Now, after nearly 10 years since the original director died by suicide and years of delays, Top Gun 2 finally is out for all the world to see. If you cried when goose died in the first one, you'll cry again as Iceman dies from throat cancer and cheer when Maverick falls in love with a new single mom played by Jennifer Connelly, who grew up watching the movie. Miles Teller plays Rooster, who is Goose's son, who helps Maverick steal a chinese plane at the end of the movie in order to succeed. Like the original, it pays homage to the past and moves towards the present. There is a volleyball like scene which is fun as well as a bar scene. Some of the plane scenes might be too intense for those who want to see it in imax, although i saw the 4k regular version instead. If you got cash to spend, then maverick is worth watching on the big screen as well as online!!!\n",

My only minor gripe is how we didn't get enough time to appreciate the real aerial shots compared to the CG shots, and the music wasn't quite up to par with the upbeat guitar and rock of the original.Easily the best film in cinemas this decade, possibly even century for aviation lovers, and an important lesson to directors on rebooting a franchise.\n",

This sequel of 1986 film Top Gun waves it magical wand and charms you all over with its cinematography, sound design and characters. Tom Cruise's earnest and sincere performance, backed with mesmerizing aerial aviation action and a heartfelt callback to its predecessor makes Top Gun Maverick a close to perfect film. The emotions , the nostalgia of past characters and friction between Tom and Mile's characters have such a warm representation that you just cant stop but admire.Definitely one of the most engrossing films of this year, Tom Cruise's flawed protagonist character grows on the viewer and they can't stop but root for him throughout. His fight against his own past and whether he will let go or not is all the film about. I might have dropped a tear or two during the end credits, which for me in all means is blockbuster cinema and easily makes my money worth.\n",

Maverick is still the Maverick of the first film albeit older and struggling with his demons and guilt which gives the character much needed depth and maturity. The way the character plots come together is natural and they all have their parts to play. The treatment of Val Kilmer in the film is superb and the story of Goose's son and his relationship with Maverick is outstanding. Let's also not forget the cinematography and how all the flight scenes were filmed in real aircraft. Best movie I've watched in years.\n",

            "Review: It is hard to beat the original Top Gun when it has the nostalgia behind it. For an 80s movie, it was ahead of its time. TGM incorporates the nostalgia without putting in too much where this movie could stand on its own without it. It makes you like this movie so much more with it and truly helps it be the sequel it needed to be. Call me indecisive, but it is hard to pick which movie is better. They both are unique but the flying alone makes TGM superior. You don't want the movie to end and wish there was more everything that makes Top Gun, Top Gun.Most sequels out there flop and this proves them wrong. Heck, this movie currently has an 8.7. It was not a lie, the plot does include Star Wars and I laughed when I figured out what those reviews meant. It didn't matter at the end of the day. I can't wait to see it again and get the DVDThis movie hits all the boxes. Go see it if you haven't and watching the first one will make you appreciate this one more.\n",

            "Review: There may be nothing more intimidating than trying to live up to the hype of an all time classic such as the original Top Gun. The fact that this was developed 36 years after the original block buster cult following classic put even more pressure on this summer release (props to waiting to a post-Covid summer). With a new director and cast of virgin \"top guns\", the pressure was that much more magnified. However, despite everything boated against this film... it delivers with enough G force to take your breath away! The backdrop, drama, conflict, and come-togetherness bring this film at the top notch of its class, I was so expecting to be disappointed and this was the exact opposite. It's almost better then original! The only negative comment is they did not have Berlin in the love scene! Otherwise... this is perfection. Oscar to Tom for the love of god and please more Miles Teller going forward.\n",

            "Review: I totally agree with some of the previous comments and reviews. This is one of rare feats where the sequel surpasses the original (The Godfather 2, Terminator 2, Aliens etc). For all those 40-50 something year old fans who grew up watching the original waiting for a decent sequel well here it is and it's SUPERB. In my view the movie has been well worth the wait as Tom Cruise has gone all out pushing himself and his team to the next level. Rather than rely on lame CGI like other movies (eg MARVEL) Mr Cruise has actual shots of fighter jets and superb aerial scenes with the actors themselves flying those jets, like no other movie.The makers have also kept very true to and paid homage to the original with the opening titles, the background music, the Danger Zone song and bringing back certain characters from the original. It also kind of has an 80s feel despite being set in modern times.The movie is surprisingly (for a commercial blockbuster) very well acted and has a good star cast. Although the story is very simple it's not as cheesy as the original and has a fantastic build up. The last 20 minutes or so are simply breathtaking. I have no idea how they shot those scenes but I can't wait for the behind the scenes/ making of documentary.In a nutshell the makers have made this movie FOR THE AUDIENCE and have kept in mind their fan base and not focused in on just cashing in on the Top Gun name / legacy. This is a worthy sequel and was worth the wait although I just wished Tom Cruise was a little younger not because he ruined anything but because i know he he is capable of so much more. Take a bow Mr Cruise. You are truly the last of the great Hollywood movie stars!I highly recommend this movie for fans of the original and fans of commercial blockbuster movies. This is a fine example of how you make an entertaining movie for everyone without compromising on quality.\n",

He needs to receive some lifetime achievement award for the longest lasting, believable (sorry Liam) action star of our generation. The story was a bit derivative of A New Hope but better as airplanes do not have inertial dampeners. A bit predictable towards the end but the action more than makes up for it.\n",

            "Review: I don't know how to put this nicely... In this movie, no one is trying. The screenplay is cookie cutter/completely predictable, the characters are all the same character (cocky navy dude-even Jennifer Connolly plays cocky navy dude), the mission is vague and the stakes are non-existent.Maverick is supposed to choose 6 pilots out of a class of about 16 for this bull's eye mission. Though, only 6 of them get any screen time. I wonder who he'll pick. The inclusion of two black characters and a Latino seems progressive until they total about 5 lines of dialogue collectively. Token, much?The best part is at the climax when the \"acting\" becomes secondary to the action. The plane stunts are cool. That's literally all I have to say about this movie though. So dull. I don't know who this is supposed to appeal to, but it isn't me.\n",

Nothing as fluid as this film has come out since before the pandemic save a title or two. Such a breath a fresh air.I went to watch this film with my father and as an 18 year old young man who never had the opportunity to see the original film in theaters could some how still feel the nostalgia radiating from this film. Maybe it was just rubbing off from all of the other middle aged men in the room whose dreams and fantasies were birthed from the original film back in 1986 but I believe it was the true magic that comes from the crew and the masterful mind of director Joseph Kosinski.Such an amazing piece of art and a must see for all nostalgia seeking, aviation loving persons. Even if you do not fit into those categories this film truly is a masterpiece in terms of fluidity and realism. Absolutely wonderful and amazing job to all who was involved in the creation of this work.\n",

            "Review: In a lot of ways Top Gun original is far superior. In TG2 The so called never seen before aerial scenes much vaunted by TC in promoting this film amounted to a fizzer compared to TG1. Some of flight scenes I dare say were embarrassingly boring. Basically it's just showing the pilots body swaying left to right while moaning and breathing heavy. The hillside or mountains in the background doesn't really portray how fast or how dangerously low the plane is flying so it's a dismal failure with all the cameras in the cockpit. In some ways it's a bit like the Emperors new clothes. Camera crew were probably too scared to say in front of TC, umm I don't think the scene or shot works...some of the dialogue was cringe worthy cheesy. None of the magic in TG1 has been replicated unfortunately. I think this movie would have been a lot better if TC was just the leading actor not also the producer.\n",

            "Review: What made this movie worth seeing was actually, believe it or not, the acting. Whoever the actor was that played Goose's son did a particularly good job. There were multiple characters that were entertaining and believable, even if the plot was a bit formulaic. There were multiple times during the action where I found myself tensing up. The plot was a bit predictable, and I had to laugh at the Star Wars: A New Hope trench run followed by the down the hole kill shot. But, hey, if it works.... I'm impressed they got Iceman in there, even if they gave Kelly McGillis the shaft. No mention of her whatsoever. Overall, I was entertained.\n",

You don't want to miss the full experience imax can provide you with, go pay for it, it's worth it ! After so much marvel crap we got crapped on us, it's so amazing to get something like this, a real movie experience ! After watching this I don't think i will be stepping into cinema to watch another marvel or other hero crap for a few years probably. This masterpiece has shown me how awful movies are today actually. I enjoyed every second of this movie. Thank you Tom for making this even though you never had to considering you don't even need money, but this is what real movie looks like. I hope people realize we got feed bs movies and stop buying into it. Movie of the year, most likely, aside from being the best movie I watched since dark knight.\n",

The action is beautiful and absolutely worth paying extra for the IMAX experience. Joseph Kosinski felt like the perfect Director for this and I can't imagine anyone doing any better.This top tear team really put you in the cockpit for this one and its sure to inspire for generations to come.\n",

But. Because it serves the story organically. The chemistry between Miles and Tom is on point. I cannot stress enough This is why we go to movies. It's escapism at its purest. With good writing to boot. Absolutely loved it. Go watch this movie. Send a message to these movie companies. Stop trying to subvert our expectations. Stop churning out garbage. Give us what we want. Great story. Use cgi for a tool. Not a crutch. It has its place in movies. No doubt.\n",

I have maybe a half dozen movies or shows that I've ever given a 10 star rating and this is definitely one my favorite movies of all time.As an avid movie watcher, this one has it all...a great well-written story, phenomenal action scenes, laugh out loud moments, tear inducing scenes, excellent acting and fantastic music. It was very easy in the theater to get deep into the story and feel the tension of the situations and characters. It's a true masterpiece.I'd take the opportunity to see this in the theaters because I don't think any average TV will do it justice. I'll likely see it in the theater a second time and I've never done that with any other movie. If you don't watch this movie (and in the theater) you are truly going to miss out.\n",

            "Review: But...This has got to be the best dang follow-up to a movie ever-as in, probably, if not absolutely, better than the first one.The story line is further evolved, for example. But, I'm not here to compare and contrast Top Gun to Top Gun Maverick. They're both excellent movies in their own right.Okay, so I walked from my house today and passed the Charlie house here in Oceanside, CA on my way to the movie theater. Just had to throw that out there...This film has just enough cheesy lines that don't cross over the cringe plateau. Quite a few references to the original, but again, not to an annoying level.Rooster (Miles Teller), looks very much like Goose and put on a stellar performance. The love-lationship with Jennifer Connolly's character wasn't the focus, so that was nice-the focus was truly on the flying, the mission, and the relationship between Rooster and Mav.As a veteran and mil spouse, I recognized the need for team building on the beach-and that was awesome. Jon Hamm's character (Cyclone) didn't see that, and honestly-that's en pointe with the military. Some leaders just over focus on the mission and forget that people do the mission and emotion influences that. I digress.Only a Tom Cruise movie can go 90min of hard core action and then have a small 60 second blurb where viewers want to cry (scene with Mav and Rooster after being shot down and in the woods).I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE NEARLY ENOUGH. It's just perfect!\n",

Cast like one would cast a Lite Beer commercial.Had a crush on Kelly McGillis then, have a bigger crush on Jennifer Connelly now, but I didnt believe either of them had a thing with the Tom Cruise character.Look, the early reviewers are rating this like its The Godfather.

            "Review: So, having not seen the first, but heard of the first Top Gun Film, I went into this one sort of blind.The film sees Maverick, 36 years on older but not exactly done, with being the daredevil pilot he was back in the day. He is tasked to work with a group of young recruits on a new mission, however, one of the recruits so happens to be the son of the man he once worked & died alongside with back in the day, can he & this son overcome their grudge & work together on this new & dangerous mission?I found the film to be pretty good. While it did drag & was a b it overly long at a couple of points, it was good for a 2 hour & 2 minute film. The action & intense scenes were pretty good as with the action sequences themselves involving the planes & close ups. The ending was ace & was a satisfying conclusion to a long awaited sequel I can remember as far back as 2013.Overall, it's pretty good. Having not seen the first film (which I intend to watch by the way), this was & is a good sequel which I'll admit I was skeptical about before watching.8/10.\n",

            "Review: I saw Top Gun:Maverick, starring Tom Cruise-the Mission:Impossible movies, Tropic Thunder; Jennifer Connelly-Alita:Battle Angel, The Rocketeer; Miles Teller-Fantastic Four_2015, Footloose_2011 and Jon Hamm-Richard Jewell, Baby Driver.This is a sequel to the 1986 Top Gun-Yep, 36 years ago-starring 2 of the original stars. Tom, aka Maverick of course and Val Kilmer, aka Iceman. Val has a minor role here since he has been battling throat cancer in his real life. He plays an admiral that needs Tom's help to train some Top Gun pilots for an impossible mission-or is that a....mission impossible? Jon, aka Cyclone plays another admiral that is spearheading the secret mission but he does not like Tom and his rule breaking attitude. Jennifer plays an old-and possibly new-girl friend that runs a bar that pilots usually hang out in and Miles, aka Rooster plays one of the trainees Tom is training and he is also the son of Anthony Edwards, aka Goose from the original movie. There are lots of flying battles, both the training and against the bad guys, and there is no CGI or green screen used during these ariel shots. The actors were in real planes, filming themselves flying, after going through real training to make it look authentic-and it does. There is a beach football scene mirroring the volleyball scene from the original and there is some good music, just like in the original. I remember hearing David Bowie, Fog Hat, the Who and of course, Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone. There is also a new song by Lady Gaga-but you can't beat Danger Zone.It's rated PG-13 for some intense action sequences and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes.This is one of those rare times where the sequel is even better than the original-and I liked the original-and I would buy this one on Blu_Ray.\n",

Try too little and don't stand out enough thanks to lazy references and pointless fan service, or they bloody nail it and make the already excellent original even better. Top Gun: Maverick went in the best way possible, it's meticulously crafted and respectful of Tony Scott's original. Over 36 years after its predecessor and in an IMAX screening nonetheless, this film bloody rocks! Joseph Kosinski and company, I take my hat off to you, I was in genuine tears by the end.\n",

            "Review: I was one year out of high school when Top Gun came out. I LOVED Tom Cruise. I had said goodbye a year previously to my (Tom Cruise lookalike) boyfriend as he went to the Air Force Academy to become a fighter pilot. So my new boyfriend forbid me from seeing Top Gun in the theater out if jealousy. Because I was an IDIOT, I honored that wish. I have always regretted that. I saw Top Gun eventually on VHS then DVD many times. So when Top Gun Maverick was being made I was STOKED. Hey Covid hit and I waited.... AND WAITED. Anyways, I was so afraid this sequel couldn't possibly live up to my expectations... WOW WAS I WRONG! This is a superior movie in every way. The writing, the cinematography, everything is perfect. The flight scenes are so exciting and immersive.... YOU MUST SEE THIS IN IMAX! The music, the callbacks to the original, all flawless. I came out of the theater PUMPED! Even my husband, who isn't impressed by anything, LOVED it. Tom Cruise really delivers and the young cast is also good. RUN to see this... it's so much fun!\n",

From the opening scene to the credits, it was perfectly paced.I don't know if I'll ever give a movie a 10, but until I find that one movie this ranks in my top-20 all-time.\n",

Also I think tom cruise should be given the distinguished flying cross four the effort he put into this film as actor. Also I like that he got too fly the tomcat one more time and he demonstrated a carrier crash landing with the net thing also the navy's around the world with carriers they have all the components they need four a cruise at sea just like any airforce base too. Also thanks I can't use words how they spent time reviewing this movie getting ready four the finished product like a when you build a vical on a assembly line.\n",

            "Review: At the beginning, let's admit that Tom Cruise is the gringo who can always deliver strong action movies like Top Gun. From directing (Joseph Kosinski) to writing (Ehren Kruger, Christopher McQuarrie, Eric Warren Singer) to soundtrack (Hans Zimmer, Harold Faltermeyer) to acting (Tom Cruise, Jon Hamm, Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Charles Parnell). The movie tells the story of Capt. Pete Mitchell (Maverick) who returns to Top Gun school again after 36 years to teach an elite group of fighters how to accomplish a mission. The story is actually good as the movie doesn't need you to watch the first movie. It's so emotional, you'll smile, sit on the edge of your seat, you'll feel the danger that they fall in. The soundtrack is as good as it can be. The cinematography is stunning and the whole movie should be seen in IMAX to enjoy every detail in. The acting is superior from everyone from Tom Cruise to every role in the movie especially that Cruise made the crew fly real real jets and they had extensive G-Force training sessions to withstand the physical demands of the G-force pressures during flights. At the end, the movie deserves the wait, the hype, and to be watched on the biggest screen available. My rating is 10/10.\n",

            "Review: Got to say, it was a pleasant surprise for me. The movie hits all the nostalgic beats. Sure, there are some not-so-smart dialogue bits from some of the characters and some of the plot parts are, err, not realistic, to say the least but this is a movie you go in and just enjoy. If nothing else, then all the flying that isn't green screened. And it looks good, very good!Also, in a market saturated with the \"Message\" of white man bad or cry havok if not enough minorities are represented, it was refreshing that the movie just ignored all that and was just a movie without any forced message. For instance, Phoenix was just as bad-ass as the boys, but no one needed to be put down for it.All in all, I recommend this movie. Even if you're not a die-hard fan of the previous one.\n",

            "Review: Sequels seldom deliver. This one did and then some. The action was unmatched, but more so the story was fresh, the script showed how Pete Mitchell had grown and become human, capable of love and admiration.It was genius how they included Iceman in the movie, and truly touching the relationship that developed over the past 30-plus years between the two heroic pilots. That was my favorite part of the movie.I thought casting a near look-alike Goose was perfect also.Jennifer Connelly was great in her role. I liked how in her role she almost always referred to Pete rather than Mav, accentuating the fact that he was a human with feelings and not just some jet jockey chasing the next big thrill.We saw this in a movie theater meant for a movie like this. Do yourself a favor and don't wait for DVD or in home streaming. It just won't be the same.\n",

            "Title:  Top Gun Maverick Thrills and Entertains, but it Just Doesn't Quite Reach the Altitude Necessary to Be a great Movie\n",
            "Review: What I liked: Popcorn humor, it got off to a promising start, beautiful Jennifer Connelly, Iceman cameo, nerve wracking final mission, callbacks to Top Gun 1986, the cool fighter jet imagery when the anti-missile tech is released, and the very end was a nice happy ending that is applaudable.What I didn't like: The middle where Maverick comes out of nowhere on the radar while they are in class and they can somehow all observe him even though he was dismissed as teacher and his subsequently being brought back felt rushed and unrealistic, picking the 6 pilots felt rushed and slightly confusing for a big moment, the soundtrack was nowhere near as good and iconic as the 1986 original (it could've used Righteous Brothers \"You've Lost that Lovin Feeling\" at the end or somewhere), the tacked on \"behind enemy lines\" ending became cartoony and literally made no difference in the end other than for another deus ex machina (only because they didn't inform the viewer that Hangman was sent, which they should have) hero-twist, and even though this was an impossible mission not one pilot died, which made it lack drama and believability.This is a decent-good movie. It's like ripping out the cliff notes of a good book and only reading them, but moreso it's like the mission Tom Cruise led his pilots on: the mission was to vertically clear the mountain on the way out at the End of the mission in order to succeed, but for the movie during that ending, the aircrafts never quite cleared the peak to be truly great. It did reach the good range though, and for movies today, maybe that's the best they can do since it seems it's all been done before.6/10.\n",

Everything about Top Gun: Maverick is sublime from the script to the breathtaking cinematography and aerial sequences with no CGI or Green Screen that would keep fans on the edge of their seats. I believe Tom Cruise, Joseph Kosinski, Christopher McQuarrie, Jennifer Connelly and the entire cast have done a brilliant job and it is worth the wait.

Especially a nearly 60 year old TC isn't making it easier. Too predictable, too similar, including some of the OG actors... some absolutely impossible maneuvers, some science fiction scenes or planes I didn't expect nor needed. Unfortunately just a 5 for me.\n",

The emotions are superbly well set throughout the two-hour editorial.There is plenty of flight action scenes and the showdown in a dazzling under-radar, no-fly-zone canyon keeps the audience in awe and excitement.But the most impressive scenes, I find to be 'Tom Cruise' reconnecting with his first major-movie-hit from the 1980s on any scale - human and professionally.08/10.\n",

So much adrenaline and the jet thrusters shake you in am IMAX sound theatre. It's all and out classic action movie which is much much better and no matter if you an 80's kid or todays generation, this will kick in so much adrenaline into you. The flight scenario shots which are shot with real sets are so good and only Tom Cruise can be so cocky and so good to pack this punch. The theater was packed on Thu evening and when the end-credits, everybody stood up and clapped. Thank you once again, for this last experience of a lifetime. I have not been excited coming out a movie theater in the last 20 years and yesterday I could feel my blood pumping when I came out. As another reviewer put it, I was 19 for those 2 hours. This is what a movie experience should be like.\n",

            "-why they didn't use American 5th gen fighters (f22 & f35) at least to suppress the sam sites.-also launching that amount of cruise missiles from a destroyer in a blink of an eye is very unrealistic.-the cruise missile aren't that fast actually as in the movie.-Iran has no Su-57, and the terrain they used is very un-iranian i.e., narrow snowy pathways with pine trees .. that looks more like Sweden actually.-that scene were they hijack a jet from an enemy airport .. is super silly.-and the f-14 start sequence is way much longer... a fighter won't start with a flip of a switch.-also .. a plane hits a building during takeoff with its front landing gear and continue like nothing happened .. i mean c'mon for god's sake mate!!!The list goes on and on...\n",

            "Review: The first movie was pretty terrible but I absolutely loved it. And when Goose died, I cried. I still cry at that scene.As for the sequel? I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. First you get to sit through Tom Cruise's hokey \"commercial\" at the beginning saying he did this for the fans. Was this to rehab his image? He's so creepy.I'm not sure what the problem was with Top Gun: Maverick. Lots of talky drama and Military politics. Blech. You have Jon Hamm playing a meanie admiral bureaucrat the same way he played Don Draper. Hamm shows a serious lack of acting range. The 2nd generation fighter pilots checked all the boxes as expected: the latina, the black guy, the nerd, the arrogant jerk. A few more thrown in for good measure.The first top gun was fresh and new. Perhaps the writers/directors/producers underestimated what needed to be done to make the sequel work? Their audience has since seen 35 years of schlock and formulaic and PC screenplays. What seemed novel in 1986 looks like laziness and boredom and stupidity in 2022.The only stand outs were two ladies. Jennifer Connelly as the Bond girl (I mean, Maverick's girl)...stood out by a mile. I've never understood why she hasn't been in more movies. And Jean Louisa Kelly makes a cameo as Iceman's wife. Both exuded warmth and depth. JLK was on the screen for maybe 3 minutes and she made more impact than any of the fighter pilots who monopolized all the other scenes. (ironically she stole the show in Mr Holland's Opus too. She's been doing it her whole career)Miles Teller isn't a bad actor, but in this movie, he's not likeable. At all. I didn't care about him at all. Goose was the heart and soul of the first movie. His son? The opposite. When you try to center a whole movie around an entitled, cranky, chip-on-his-shoulder son, you have Top Gun: Maverick.The only rewarding part was when Maverick humiliates the baby fighter pilots who think they have nothing to learn. He smashes their GenZ arrogance into a zillion pieces and it was glorious.\n",

            "Review: When the opening credits started up I thought we were in for something special. The music, the graphics.. wow.However the movie ended up being a bit too centered on Maverick where it could have focused a bit more on the supporting characters like Rooster. It was also a bit too melodramatic in parts to the point of being a tad boring inbetween the action.The music was generally great but Lady Gaga really felt out of place. Could've ended on one of the bangers from the original movie to leave a better ending impression.The action though was intense and had a lot less CGI than current movies so that was sweet to see.Overall still a good action movie to see at the theater but needed a bit more to be truly great.\n",

Thank you Tom Cruise. I have nothing else to say. Top Gun got me returning to the theatres. No other movie could do that. I should do at least that for this marvel of a movie.

It is so so so amazing. I cried at the ending. It's one of the best action movies y'all will ever watch. It's a love letter to aviation. To cinema. Tom Cruise's dedication to this craft is unparalleled. This movie is a theatre experience. The sound design of this movie is so amazing. It'll invest you as a viewer. The cinematography is unlike any other movie. As the name suggests, Maverick is the sole focus of this movie but the supporting cast is amazing too. Miles Teller and Monica Barbaro. Jennifer Connelly is a smokeshow. The exceptional action cope up for the inconveniences of this film. The intro of this movie is iconic. Top Gun Maverick is better than the original. It has high octane, informed and stylized Dog Fights. You wil not believe Tom is turning 60 this year. It is awesome. AWESOME!\n",

            "Review: The film delivers what it promised, it's almost 40 years of time since the original Top Gun was released in 1986 and it surely blends in with the cinema and gave Tom cruise a instant fame. But the time has changed and Tom Cruise as well but he still has the aura or Audacity to give us the film that we expected or more than our expectations. The film itself is a positive factor to watch the film in theatre, whether it is Aerial scenes, dogfighting sequences and The misunderstanding between MAVERICK (TOM CRUISE) and ROOSTER ( MILES TELLER) who is a son of Late pilot GOOSE played by (ANTHONY EDWARDS) in 1986 film. But all feels Extremely Stupifying when Tom Cruise hits the screens and for no wonder why he insisted not to use CGI instead all actors were in a cockpit flying jets, because this film deserve to be seen big screen as possible and for it's outstanding Visual/Cinematography made you feel like you are in the cockpit. In the end this film is not only for fanboys or fangirls this is for every CINEPHILE/MOVIE BUFF\n",

The setup of the movie, the cast, the reason of all that action, characters chemistry and ofcourse all the action scenes.If you haven't watched the first one, better to watch it first or at minimum listen/watch a recap of it on YouTubeCan't miss this one on theater.

            "Review: Being a fan of aviation, I've waited a long long time for this. Going into the theater I was worried about the story after seeing the trailers, that all went away fast. From the beginning, I was in awe.. The story, the history, the action, the camera work, the sound, the editing.. Perfect! I can't remember the last time I felt this way about a film. I had chills. The drama from the first move rolls over in to this sequel in a best way possible. My 3 boys thought it was one of the best they have seen too. They didn't want the move to end and are begging me to take them back to see it again. I know we will.THEY NAILED IT!!\n",

            "Review: I had a lot of fun watching this in theatres. It was a classic blockbuster and I hope more film makers go back to this formula because it's what the people want. Not every movie needs to relate to current political/social climate or leave us deep in thought when we leave the theatre. Sometimes we just want to see some really good looking people in action sequences, with a dash of romance and redemption.Plus, getting to see Val Kilmer on screen again warmed my heart.\n",

            "Review: Saw this last night, what a terrific movie! References the original film and storyline without relying on it.Not a complicated plot but sucked me in properly to keep me glued to the film the whole time.The original Top Gun was a big flick for its time and I think this will be no exception. Where everybody nowadays is running to the computer nerds to do half the movie in CGI, we had real fighter jets in the skies, which made for absolutely incredible cinematography.Action was intense, issues based on the first movie were great, along with the spawn of a new rivalry. Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and the rest of the cast did a great job.\n",

Tom Cruise reprises his iconic role as Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell whose naval career in spiral leads him to be re-assigned to his alma mater to instruct hot shot young pilots for a deadly secret mission while also struggling with his demons: namely the death of his beloved BFF by dealing with his angry son (Teller) as one of the new recruits. Filmmaker Joseph Kosinski pulls out all the stops by filming in IMAX with some truly astounding aerial footage with the real actors in the planes (um not CGI'd!) with hairy situations aplenty as well as touch stoning with the original's vibe including a touching reunion with Kilmer's Iceman.

            "Review: At the beginning of the movie, I was fascinated by how realistic the movie is, jets, engines, flare, combat, stunt, mountain, and sky. I have never seen a movie containing all these elements together, it's just incredible. I was wondering if it is a real jet in the movie, I guess it is coz it feels absolutely real. The plot was flawless, just like the theme song of this movie, You take my breath away. It's almost like a Mission Impossible movie but in F18 Jet. When Tom Cruise seemed sacrifice during the mission, tears run into my eyes, I am so moved, luckily he survived in the end. This movie is rooted in American patriotism, but I won't feel awkward comparing it to War Wolf. Instead, I truly felt proud of these great aviators, I wish I am a real American with an American passport at the time.\n",

There are also not really dog fights shown but just a mission that has to be conducted where our top gun heros are more or less sitting ducks hiding and hoping to escape without beeing discovered.

For those of us that grew up in the 80s with Top Gun you have slight trepidation that , like many sequels, it would disappoint, we shouldn't have worried. If you're a fan of the original then you get extra out of this movie and would recommend being familiar with original before seeing this. The nostalgia, the tips of the hat to the original, the action, the humour in places and seat of the pants flight scenes all made for one of the best movies in a long long time, it was just what we all needed.\n",

I literally fell asleep every time Jennifer c. Would go on screen, those scenes where so useless. Then just the story was poor. In 2021(that's the time the film was originally gonna be released) that is our big mission, compared to all the Middle East air raids we had. But I will say the jet scenes are great and best part is the end, where the action is and you don't have to watch that terrible love connection that tom cruise always has in movies.\n",

The story is paper thin and almost the same as the previous Top Gun, the actors as well. The directors went to great length to get realistic flight scenes by strapping the actors in real F18's.

The dialogues felt unnatural and half-heartedly with no intensity and little chemistry, as if the actors felt intimidated or just focused on remembering their lines rather than acting. Storyline rushed, not enough character development even for an action movie. Forced rivalry within the group that isn't built up enough to be believable. Even though the action scenes may have been of higher quality on the sequel, the magic of the first movie was mostly gone. It had all the ingredients but just poorly executed.

            "Review: This film succeeded with its impressive practical effects and very well-achieved aerial stunts. The predictable plot offers little in the way of surprise in the end. The new characters are one-dimensional generic types and provide little cause to care about them. Tom Cruise's performance is charming and is easily the best human element in the film.So much of the runtime re-hashes or reinvents familiarly favorite scenes from the original film (shirtless, sandy, athletic montage; \"Great Balls of Fire\" at the piano in sunglasses; Maverick on a motorcycle chasing a jet along the runway; surprised reactions to learning your Top Gun instructor was the person you met a bar the night before, etc.), that there is too little plot remaining to justify this film as a sequel rather than a remake. I would rather watch the original film for those scenes as that film had real charm. Additionally, the forced love interest with the ever-pleasant Jennifer Connelly character does not work well to advance the larger plot, and only adds to the run time. Tom Cruise has an urgent mission to save the world, but he has time in the evenings to rehash an old flame we know of only by a throwaway line in the original film? I don't buy it.It was nice to see in this Top Gun film more attention paid to enemy combatants instead of the pure training as in the original film. This was a nice concept which suffered in the end. The main difficulty with the plot is this film wants us to believe the bad guys are hidden in the mountains somewhere and only low-flying crackerjack pilots can save the day. (Flying in fast and low under a time crunch to strike an impracticably minuscule target while dodging overwhelming aerial defenses is the Death Star attack all over again...but without Porkins).And who are the bad guys? Considering the amount of attention they receive in this film, the main villains are the three Rear Admirals. There is no subtlety with these characters as they are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians. The only Admiral not a jerk is Iceman. The \"real\" enemy feels like an afterthought. Sure, the bulk of the film after the first 30 minutes serves to train to fight these unseen foes, but we only get to real action with the baddies in the last 20 minutes of run time. The rest of the time the Admirals create the conflict and tension with Maverick, and it never makes sense why they should care so much. And so I can't care so much.\n",

            "Review: The original had everything. A believable story line, great characters, dog fights and whilst a serious script it had some classic one liners. I know it off by heart having watched it over 100 times.TG Maverick abandons all of this other than the amazing flying scenes - in fact that is the only thing that saves the film.Far too many nods to the original - it got cheesy by the end.The script was like something out of Mission Impossible. In fact that is what the premise of the film was - an impossible mission. But with this impossible mission everyone came home apart from poor Ice Man who's death and funeral only took about 24 hours - probably the fastest in US history.The first half of the film felt empty as we caught up with what Maverick has been up to for the last 20 or so years but in reality we didn't learn much. The last half was action packed but only just managed to save the movie.I'd have loved to have spent less time with the Maverick catch up, less time with the shoehorned Penny Benjamin and more time learning about the pilots. This could have been a perfect segway into a 3rd Top Gun with Rooster and Hangman taking over the Maverick and Ice Man rivalry.I desperately wanted to walk out of the cinema having loved it - I wanted to text all my mates saying how good it was but I couldn't. I rattled off a couple of sentences surmising the plot to my wife and realised how silly it all was:Maverick is a test pilot or a secret plane - he takes it up against orders and blows it up - doesn't get sacked as Ice Man conveniently phones up as it happens and brings him back to Top Gun for an impossible mission that no one else in the world can train people for - he trains them - gets sacked - steals a plane and completes impossible mission - gets his job back - flies impossible mission - gets shot down without parachute opening and is fine - Rooster saves him - gets shot down - they meet up and steal an old plane - shoot down 2 super jets and save the day - then they land and they then make up and work on planes together.I don't know, maybe I'm being harsh. Knock 30 mins off the start with all the Maverick and Penny stuff and it would have been pretty awesome.Will probably watch it another 99 times.\n",

            "Title:  Intense flight mission sequences and nostalgia make Top Gun 2 a summer blockbuster once again\n",
            "Review: I was a big Top Gun fan (as was mostly everyone I knew) back in the late 80's and early 90's. It was the highest grossing movie of 1986 for a reason. So I was very excited to finally get a chance to see this sequel a day earlier than the advertised release date. We went at the very first matinee and everyone in the theatre enjoyed it. It was fun and triggered lots of chuckles and laughs with subtle humor.I cried at probably at least five or six scenes, whether from nostalgia, heavy hearted references to either character deaths or character relationships, or the romance scenes. In addition to the humor and sad scenes, there was also some good drama and intense jet fighter sequences. The director and writers blended the concept of a difficult fighter jet mission with fun training scenes, romance, and callbacks to the original.I'm not going to lie- this is a good movie. I'm not exaggerating that I barely blinked during the entire run time of 2 hours and 10 minutes, with which most of the time when I wasn't being tear-jerked, I had a silly grin on my face or was chuckling at the subtle humor. However, I will say that if I wasn't a big fan of the first one, I might not have liked it as much as I did. That's because it was a great as a fan of the first one to have so many references to anything in part one.The ending was good, but it could have been even better, even though it was intense enough to have me sweating a little. But one of the biggest drawbacks of Top Gun 2 is also one of its strengths, in my opinion, in a way. I got the impression that ultimately this is a movie that is more made for kids and teens than adults, and what that means is that the content is mostly light and shies away from any kind of violence or sexuality, which would have made it feel more mature and realistic. For example, in the original Top Gun, it has heavy profanity, really intense romance and sex for a PG movie, a pilot dies depicted with a face covered in blood after ejecting, and the dialogue by actors like Tom Skeritt make the stakes seem higher and more realistic: \"what we do up there is dangerous\". Maverick's dad's fate in Vietnam is also discussed to paint a realistic picture of the stakes. Overall, it just felt more gritty, whereas \"Top Gun Maverick\" keeps it ultra \"clean\" considering the dangers of flying and the explicit nature of locker room talk and sexuality.What this means is you get a sequel movie that is much more appropriate for teens and kids than adults, yet being an adult I kind of wish the stakes would have felt as heavy as they could have been. It would have been sadder, but it also would've been more mature and realistic. It is what it is. It's still a good movie, but it could have been better.I'm glad that I saw it early. As a nostalgic, emotional, fun summer popcorn movie, it was a blast, but if you're expecting a Best Pic contender or something remarkably original and profound, unfortunately the writers and directors \"had the shot, but refused to fire it\", and for that the movie comes up a bit short in cliches, cheese, and yes even lacking believability at key moments. I think there was an Oscar-contender somewhere in this story, but the creators of it decided to go another direction, more into a \"popcorn\" and feel-good movie of the summer. That's fine and I don't blame them since the target audience was clearly younger kids, which makes it a nice, wholesome movie for a change.Jennifer Connelly, despite a small supporting role, was the key to this movie. Other than Cruise, who does have a few stumbling moments at times, her confident experience as an actor makes every look she gives and line she says add credibility to what is an otherwise rather superficial script for supporting actors. The other good role that stands out is Val Kilmer's pleasantly surprising (and funny at times) reappearance as Admiral Iceman. Then, Teller does a pretty impressive job as Goose's kid.At the end of the day, \"Top Gun Maverick\" succeeds and soars as a nostalgic, deeply emotional surprise triumphant action flick, with flight battle scenes so intense it'll make you sweat in your seat, while it also crashes into some of the mountainous cliches that have been built and established by Hollywood throughout the years. So grab a seat and some popcorn and take a trip back to the 80s and 90s, a much simpler time, with some updated special effects and tech upgrades.\n",

            "Review: Top Gun: Maverick is a good sequel to the original, with some spectacular dogfights; a fine production and solid acting make the piece whole. I also dare to say, that most who like the first movie will like this one too. The greatest con: what Maverick mostly misses is an interesting story. The story is of very simplistic nature, a very basic one that we all - in whatever context set - watched a zillion times before. For sure Maverick is good pop-corn cinema with some fine moments, and tasty for the right audience, but not as good as many reviewers here on Imdb claim boldly. In my opinion for example, The Edge of Tomorrow is the far stronger movie - it got good acting, a fine production, lots of action and spectacular visuals too, but, last but not least, a well crafted and superior script (compared to Maverick). Exact rate: 7 + 1 for the spectacular visuals. A fine flight, but not an excellent one.\n",

The movie started with some great throwbacks to the original which was great and the longer the movie went on...the more off the rails it got. Great scenes of the F-18 at times, but the end mission? Ridiculous. Just became almost cartoonish with the plot. Tried to do too much with it. Not that the original was \"realistic\"....but this ending....come on.

            "Review: This movie is action at its finest. The way they explain that the actors are feeling what it's really like to be in a fighter jet really adds to the movie. The love interest is weird in the movie and the punchlines and call backs seem forced. However, those are my only criticism toward this movie. This is a much watch in theaters! It won't be the same at home but it gets your heart racing and it's just a really fun ride.\n",

Only the put in love story could have been completely left out, because of being pointless and unnecessary.All in all for everyone who might be interested in action films, anyone who loves jets or flying or anyone who likes Cruise should watch this.\n",

            "Review: An epic adrenaline rush created by some of the most unbelievable high-octane, real-life aerial sequences ever made. You feel like you've been in the jet the entire movie (prepare to sweat!). Calling this an action movie doesn't really do it justice - it's more of an immersive thrill ride.Top Gun: Maverick pays homage to its original on multiple occasions, filling you with nostalgia. A few of the characters are rather one-dimensional and some of the dialogue feels predictably simple, but the storyline delivers. Tom Cruise defies physics and his age once again, delivering on his promises of using real planes and no CGI.This is what a big blockbuster film can be! The bar has been raised and everyone else has been put on notice.Verdict: Watch it.\n",

            "Review: Tom Cruise is back as Maverick in the sequel entitled \"Top Gun Maverick\". I was not a huge fan of the original film but I thought it was a very good, entertaining movie when I saw it on videotape back in the eighties.This sequel is just as good as the original film and is worth seeing on the big screen. The cast includes Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Jon Hamm, Miles Teller and Val Killer. The film is well made and well acted. If you liked the first film you will probably enjoy this one too. The story is simple but there is never a dull moment. I hope you enjoy \"Top Gun Maverick\".\n",

            "Review: Ever back in the day go to someone's house and sit thru home movies of their vacation? Maverick felt like sitting thru Tom's telling of his current personal movie with cuts of his old home movies. From the opening clip with Tom vouching for what you are about to see was not CGI, I got a bad feeling how it was a shot and who wad in it was more important than a story. Borrowing directly from Star Wars IV, Dambusters, etc we get a lame plot of gee can we hit a difficult target that's well defended. And after we're done shooting the hole we'll have aerial combat. The scenes of Tom bouncing first left and then right in his cockpit are shown over and over after we have to watch other pilots doing same. As for plot, we need pilots in planes because there is GPS jamming but that didn't stop a hoard of cruise missiles from flying thru the same airspace to bash the enemy airbase. An airbase that is home to scary 6th generation fighters we're told again and again. Later we find out those fighters are parked exposed on runways while a protective hangar is being used to shelter a remnant F14. Coincidence? I think the better movie would have been Tom training to kids for the attack only to have the timetable advanced. To save their lives, Tom flies overwatch in the skunk works plane from Scene 1 and engages the enemy's high tech fighters in the next evolution in air combat. Now that's Top Gun 2.0!\n",

The more things change....Is this Academy Award material? Of course not. Is it really fun? Very much so! The first movie worked so well they basically made it again - which was fine by me. Aircraft carrier B roll, some hard-a** admirals stuck relying on Maverick, 80's tunes, amazing flying sequences and an evil empire to confront. Toss in bad guys that look like Darth Vader in superior jets with a Death Star trench run, and what's not to love?This movie was made to be seen in a theater and for the audience that enjoyed the original. It worked on me. Now I'm going to do something I haven't done since I was a kid... go see this movie in the theater a second time.\n",

            "Review: Much much better than I was actually expecting. I find the original to be a very mixed bag, but this was a really great sequel. I was surprised at how much of an emotional punch this one had with Tom Cruise's character revisiting old characters and memories of his early Top Gun years, especially with Iceman. The flight action sequences are incredible and so well done I was hooked the entire time and on the edge of my seat. There's a few nods to the original too and the music still rocks. Honestly this might be the biggest surprise of 2022 for me so far.8/10.\n",

            "Review: This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development \"hell\" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate \"Iceman\" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!\n",

We loved the storyline and think Miles Teller is well cast as is Jennifer Connelly. As ever, Tom Cruise shows up and proves there is a reason he is the most popular movie star alive today. Thanks for honoring your fans. We are also glad you waited to put this on the big screen. It was worth the wait. Favorite part was with Val Kilmer. Definitely a must see!\n",

            "Review: Decent storyline mixed with plentiful in flight action makes this movie worth watching. Cruise surrounds himself with talent from Ed Harris and Jon Hamm to Jennifer Connelly and Miles Teller. The supporting cast shines also. The melodrama of Goose's death and the animosity his son feels toward Maverick doesn't detract from an over the top movie we all have been waiting for. Editing, production and casting nailed it with the writers making the best of the tripe from the original. I give it 9 stars but the only flaw I can seriously think of was that it was based on the original released in 1986 and that movie was lacking in so much except style.\n",

My husband has been waiting for 2 years for it to come out and made me promise that I would go to the theater with him. I couldn't get over how well Tom Cruise does in a dramatic scenes. He's always done action movies, the whole while he could have been doing drama. The story is very good, and they didn't overplay the airplane scenes. They were careful in choosing which ones to do, building lots of tension and I found myself squirming in my seat. I even cried once or twice. This was a great movie all the way around.\n",

            "Review: I love the original Top Gun and I knew this movie had no chance to be as good as the first one and it wasn't. There are many flaws, some situations make little sense, there is little chemistry between many of the characters and some of them seem to be caricatures rather than real humans. There were also too many throwbacks in my opinion, few less would still send a message to the fans of the original and they wouldn't be so in your face.That being said, the movie is a good piece of action flick, it has this 80s feel and it doesn't really try to be something that it isn't. Good acting by Cruise and pretty thrilling fight and flight scenes. I saw it in IMAX and I would argue seeing it in a cinema makes a difference. The plot is thin, but it doesn't matter. I liked it.\n",

            "Review: It's a by the numbers sequel where Maverick, who supposedly got over Goose's death by throwing his dog tags into the sea, didn't. By the end of the movie it felt like I'd watched a very long comic book. A comic book that is politically correct and where even the American characters who aren't particularly nice aren't all that bad.Maverick has to train a group of hot shots while staying under the radar of a rule following Admiral who believes the day of the pilot is over and that autonomous drones are the answer to modern air warfare.The mission is to bomb an Iranian nuke site - a mission perfect for autonomous drones.So despite only lasting two months as a Top gun instructor, and being a maverick, Maverick is selected to teach a group of young pilots to carry out the mission. He teaches his team by individually shooting each one of them down in training, having them play football at the beach and telling them how difficult the mission will be - while fighting his PTSD.Despite the unreal action - Maverick treats the US Navy like his own private flying club, flying between two aircraft flying it tight formation, then spiralling towards the ground with Goose's son in the other plane - this is a slow movie.The action comes toward the end, but as America is great and Iran is bad, we don't have much to worry about. Even the enemy 5th generation fighters decide to give up their advantage of stealth and decide to engage Maverick visually.To me it felt like this film lacked the character development, twists surprises and story. So much money, time and effort has been put into a movie which is more an echo of the first, rather than being a sequel with its own kind of magic.\n",

The flying scenes were unbelievably amazing, which literally gave me goosebumps! The visuality, the sound and the music together are a real masterpiece. I didn't know if I was going to smile or cry of enjoyment during watching. You can't get any better action scenes from a movie. The actors were mostly good - especially Tom Cruise. I have to say that the story was kind of the typical, American military story, and some of the dialogue scenes were a little too long for my part, but the flying scenes made up for most of it. Anyway, strongly recommending for every action-movie lover!\n",

What a success story, and a great send off to one of the cinema's greatest characters (no not Maverick!). Kudos to the director, actors, but especially the unsung script writers whose job was to get correct all of the technical jargon necessary to make the plot believable. I won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen it .... but, SEE IT!! IT'S THE NEW FEEL GOOD MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!!! GLEE :)\n",

            "Review: So I just walked out of the theatre catching an early show of Top Gun 2: Maverick. This is going to be an honest and fair review for people curious to just how good the movie is (as that is what my biggest question was).First off, I'd like to begin by stating: this is not a \"bad\" movie at all. It's not bad, so you can get that right out of the way. That leaves the question: \"Just how good is it though?\" To answer that fairly, it must be broken down into pros and cons.Let's start with the pluses (pros). First off, I personally need to say that Jennifer Connelly alone is an absolute mega-bonus to this movie. For all of those JC fans out there, you will not be disappointed. In fact, I don't know if this is a beautiful movie, or if Jennifer Connelly's face makes it a beautiful movie, but I'd lean more towards the latter. The final result, however it is equated, though, is a beautiful movie.Next, we'll give a plus (pro) to the nostalgia factor. While an objective critic or someone who never saw Top Gun (1986) would be less interested in this and perhaps critical of it, it was definitely a strength of Top Gun: Maverick. Every single time there was a callback to Part I (1986) or reference or appearance or mention of the Part I characters, it really worked in the movie. Nothing felt overly forced except for maybe one small moment toward the end so it was nice to see them tie in a plotline to the original.Thirdly, let's talk romance and return back to Jennifer Connelly. This was another solid addition into the story. It added to the human side and emotional side, and I think without this balance of it, the movie might have suffered by being overly reliant on the air and flight scenes.In discussing the pros, the final thing to mention is the action scenes. While I didn't think they were immensely better \"overall\" than Top Gun (1986), the final mission sequences were incredibly intense. Intense is the perfect word to describe it. You will be glued into your seat, unable to move while taking in the air acrobats towards the end.Probably the best part about TG:M is that it is truly never boring except for a brief moment toward the beginning. It has that feel that you can't miss a minute. This is probably due to the tight editing. I had to go to the bathroom from the first scene, but I held it in the entire movie so I didn't miss anything. That's how fast it moves. It is very entertaining and fast-moving. The 2 hour, 10 minute runtime truly does \"fly\" by, no pun intended.Now, unfortunately, I have to be honest and admit that there are cons, and like many overly hyped movies, some of them are related to expectations and the movie being hyped so much before going in. This is subjective, but for me personally, I had heard some people who had reviewed TG:M early make claims that \"it was WAY better than the original\", it may be \"nominated for Best Picture\", and \"this is Tom Cruise's BEST movie\". To each their own, and I'm not judging the people who said these things because they may really feel that way because they liked the movie so much, but I would have to be honest and say that claims such as these are a little bit of a stretch, in my humble opinion.This by no means is to say the movie is bad. It's good. But I can't fully agree with these sensational headlines or claims I've read or heard. Now, to be fair, Best Picture is ultimately determined by competition for that particular year (and in recent years up to 10 movies can now be nominated), so it's not impossible, but if it came down to a conventional 5 nominees, this definitely probably wouldn't make the cut even though I wish it did because that would be cool. The one BP-level quality that it would have if any at all that might draw in voters is the emotional components. This movie will \"move\" you, mostly thanks to Connelly, but it probably won't be enough to get a nomination and many action movies also have the same ability and still don't get a nomination (even the 1986 movie had emotional aspects to it and that didn't get nominated). One category I do believe TG:M will have a great chance of winning is in Editing, and maybe it has a solid shot at sound and song (just like when it won for that category in 1986).I also don't believe this is Cruise's best movie ever or even in his top 5, maybe even top 10. Controversially, I think he was better in Part I than in this. And believe it or not I still like the first one better. That concludes an analysis on the cons in terms of expectations.My biggest criticism of the movie on its own is simply that I thought that it could have been even better. I understand the big budget and they're limited on logistics and what they can film, but I felt like: as good as the ending was, I had an idea for something even better, and because this is a Spoiler review, I can say that it would have been cool if all 4 partners were still in the air in an all out dog fight (and I actually thought this would be the end result based on preceding scenes) with the enemy jets rather than only Mav and one other companion.I also have to mention and complain about how Hangman came out of nowhere for the final splash when last time we saw him he was still on the Aircraft Carrier and called off so as a viewer, you are left wondering, \"where did he come from?\" We get it. He pulled a \"Maverick\" and disobeyed orders probably, or Hamm changed his mind, but they should have showed this so it wasn't sort of cliche. But to be fair, look, I get it, it's a movie and it is plausible that they sent Hangman. It's just that they should have showed it so it wasn't one of those shootout cliches where the hero comes out of nowhere.One final criticism is that some of the acting, only at certain times, could have been better. And I think Part I had better acting overall, even from smaller roles. But this movie has to be taken for what it is, which is a fun summer movie just to have a good time at.TG:2 is rated PG-13, and sadly they are mostly aiming at teenagers for some of the big moments in the script; the good news is that it is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, containing far less cursing than the first Top Gun and even less graphic love scenes (by far). There are handful of s words and one f word at an intense moment, but overall it is very mild compared to the first one. There is no nudity or intense sex scenes, but just innuendo on the romance side.As a whole, TG:2 is a very enjoyable summer motion picture. If you have any interest in the movie, you will laugh, cry, be thrilled, maybe even feel patriotic, and be interested in the military logistics presented for the missions. Cruise does his best at an older age to nail his lines, and while maybe not possessing the charisma that only a young, 24 year old hot shot rising movie star could display, he certainly carries the movie with a commitment to the role. A shout out must also go to Miles Teller, who is sufficient as Goose's son.If you are looking for a fun summer movie, anticipating the nostalgia for the Top Gun 1986 hit, want a theatre movie that the whole family can enjoy, or you simply like a well-made mixture of drama, action, and romance, you really can't go wrong by giving Top Gun:Maverick a watch on the big screen. However, I would recommend lowering expectations going in to see it so you aren't expecting it to be an Oscar winner or Cruise's best movie ever. It is definitely a good movie though. How good? That will ultimately be more subjective with this movie than any one I can think of.7/10.\n",

            "Review: Thirty-six years worth that of the wait. Tom Cruise returns to his star making role of Pete Maverick Mitchell that is now a Captain but he has not changed his way of doing things hint his nickname.Those over him like Ed Harris and Jon Hamm both not agreeing on a professional level what he does but seem to albeit reluctantly have a respect for him personally.He is reluctantly either given the choice to go back to the Top Gun school but as a teacher or face dishonorable discharge.Slowly yet surely he has earned the respect of the other pilots. Miles Teller as Rooster Bradshaw holding a grudge against Maverick over his late father, Goose Bradshaw's death in the original as the latter was his best friend.We see a very ill Val Kilmer in a two to three minutes as his former rival turned close friend Iceman now an admiral. It is very sad but very much worth remembering.Jennifer Connolly instead of Kelly McGinnis as the new love interest and single mother as the one that got away, the former not so much the latter.Maverick is more married to his job and that is why he never got married nor had kids.Great support also from breakout star Glen Powell as a pilot named Hangman who is cocky as he and Teller's Goose have a rivalry there.Movie is dedicated to the memory of the original director Tony Scott, who tragically died from suicide in 2012.\n",

Bruckheimer always makes a good action/drama.Hated to wait almost 2 years to see it, but it was a great movie.\n",

I dont know how they did it, but some scenes really worked and were as accurate as it is doable without using cgi. They dont make movies like this anymore. Writing this I decide to give it an 8 instead of a 7 out of 10.\n",

            "Review: This movie looks incredible, it has great scenes and the action is cutting edge. This isn't a good movie though. It goes through identical plot beats of the previous movie and Maverick goes through the same development he went through in the first movie. His only development is in the form of not being so protective of Rooster. The fact though is stemmed from his previous insecurity of losing his old partner! The movie does nothing new and its really boring when characters start talking because none of them are interesting and none of the comedy landed for me whatsoever. The movie is just a basic action flick and doesn't take any new or interesting directions for any of its characters. The only time you will care is when the planes come on the screen and the action tries to take your brain away from the barebones story and characters.\n",

Granted there were obviously some unrealistic bits, but they never broke my emersion ... and cmon its a movie.

I was scared that the scenario wouldn't make sense but it does. I can even tell that sometimes, you feel emotive aaaand there is a bit of humor which will make you smile for sure. However, a few things are pretty predictable. But still two good hours at the cinema! Of course, the effects are AMAZING and obviously, you feel the 36 years gap between the two movies haha. A real pleasure for your eyes, but also for your ears with Hans Zimmer's music and some old songs we hear in the first movie. Overall, I really loved it and I recommend it to watch something cool, with action and to have a great time without a headache.\n",

            "Review: If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.\n",

Casting was inspired - especially for Goose's son, who bears such a great resemblance.They even had me fooled that Maverick might actually be killed off and the rest of the movie be about the rest of the team having to fight their way home using all that he'd taught themOk, it was formulaic in parts - the love interest, the redemption with Goose's son, the hard-ass pupil who comes around, the last second saving the day,etc. That didn't spoil the fun and immense pleasure though. A film can stick to the formula but if it's this well done then that's absolutely fine.Perrin thought they'd put the original film reel in by mistake when it started - all carriers and 'danger Zone'. Brilliant!And how in the heck does Tom Cruise still look so good at almost 60 years old...!??97/100.\n",

The kinda tribute to the prequel was nostalgic at moments like the background music, the first few scenes, etc. As far as the actors are concerned each one of them did a fantastic job especially Tom Cruise and Miles Teller. Considering everything about the movie, it was a great movie. One more thing, please don't do injustice by watching this at home. No TV in the world can do justice to the amount of hard work the film crew has put in that's why experience it in your nearest theaters.\n",

The screenplay keeps moving us as a page of Maverick's beautiful love, a page of indescribable sadness at the loss of his friend, a page of training to master students. The director has given back the classic scenes, shots and light flow featured in the previous work! . The truth is that \"Tom Cruise\" continues to dedicate his body and life to his art without the slightest thought! .

            "Review: Considering the original Top Gun took military aviation films to a whole new level. Where does Top Gun 2 take you it goes above and beyond once again. The flying sequences with the use of imax cinema cameras is breathtaking. My only criticism relates to the film without action sequences. Could the backgrounds of the other characters in the film been established better and the chemistry between them. Looking forward to seeing in imax. I feel the need for speed.\n",

            "Review: A well made sequel in which it surpasses its predecessor . Top Gun 1986 was a commercial hit , eventhough it had weak plot and was not much engaging . But this time it's different , in this movie right from first movie had proper goal and traveled towards the goal . Plot was pretty simple a asusual Team on mission story , but way they build tense around the mission by showing its difficulties makes more intresting . Joseph Kosinski's as director done a spectacular job . Cast wise each and every cast gave their best . Tom Cruise doing this role after 36 years delivered marvelous performance . Miles Teller playing as Roose ( son of Goose character in Top Gun ) was literally show stealer . Jennifer Connelly done her part well . Relationship between Roose and Maverick was emotional . Each and every action sequence with flight jet was very well made , especially last 30mins literally gave me a seat edge experience . Only drawback I felt was romance track . They missed to explain the absence of Charlie's Character . Overall a must watch movie . PLEASE DON'T MISS IT TO WATCH IT ON BIG SCREEN .\n",

            "Review: Well, just came back from watching Top Gun: Maverick and I absolutely loved it. The perfect movie experience for cinemas and so much fun.It has a strong message about second chances and how we are never too old to live the life we want to live and be our best version. It's going to hit hard with older audiences for sure. The action scenes are AMAZING. And the ending is great, very emotional. My best friend, who I've never seen him cry with a movie in cinemas, cried the whole last 10 minutes. Several other people clapping, cheering and crying too.Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly are amazing in supporting roles, but it is Tom Cruise's show (and my favorite performance from him since Magnolia).Don't miss it!\n",

I'm happy to see Val Kilmer played his role with his pains. Sadly he dies at the end which it is Hollywood but can't stop thinking of his courage, and if you have a chance to see his movie check it out!Blasting images and strong scenes in the aircraft gives you goose bumps. Amazing film with seventies music as the eighties one to remind the first movie.I am happy I saw this one and thank these guys to give us that brilliant movie.Just wow.\n",

            "Review: I saw this last night on IMAX, which for this movie is a must, the sound and picture quality is pretty essential. I thought the original was great fun, a little bit too homoerotic, but well made with great flying sequences. A movie I loved as a kid in the 80's but got less enthused as I aged. This movie beats the original hands down, and I would put it in my top 10 sequels. The flying sequences are the best anyone has ever seen on celluloid, the story is a clever one, which I won't spoil, but is full of little surprises. The cast are all great and the directing from Joseph Kosinski is amazing. I'll go to the cinema 40+ times this year and I strongly doubt I'll see a better blockbuster in 2022. Well done.\n",

            "Review: Tom Cruise at his usual best. Maverick has to go back to Top Gun to teach. Teaching top gun graduates to undergo a dangerous, maybe even impossible, mission. There's a conflict in the group and within the Navy to be resolved. Maverick solves these in his inimitable way by breaking rules and pushing the envelope. There's a romantic interest too. The film builds towards the ultimate confrontation. Quite a few twists and turns and a climatic ending. Worth seeing again. I saw it in an Odeon \"iSense\" cinema. I intend to see it in an Imax.\n",

I hope this movie reaches the expected ROI.\n",

I don't like all the CGI these days, and this movie 'felt' like there was none. I need to know how they did it because it looked like these actors were really flying. It's a must see for the theater as the sounds of the jets were absolutely thrilling. Goosebumps.

I'm bias because Tom Cruise is my favourite actor but, he puts on that jacket like he never left the role it's marvellous to watch him and all he's done with this movie. The rest of this cast are truly remarkable and totally believable in this world. Miles Teller goes an extra mile with convincing the audience that he truly is \"Goose's son\" I thought that the story was masterful and the action and flying, although sometimes seems at little inaccurate, THRILLING. This film will be a film i will watch every year after watching the original before it. I watched it with some DBOX seats (seats that rumble and move to the action of the movie) and Truly was Immersed it was awesome. Top Gun Maverick Truly lives up to the Name. So yes \"I felt the Need, The Need For Speed.\"\n",

It has taken 36 years that includes a 2 year delay due to the pandemic for us to finally see this film. Is it worth it? Absolutely.When you hear the iconic Top Gun anthem and then Danger Zone it took me right back to when I first watched Top Gun on VHS (remember that?) and seeing the crew working on F-14 Tomcats on the deck of the aircraft carrier for the first time and being mesmerised.. Only this time it's F-18 Hornets but the effect is still the same.What follows is 2 hrs 11 mins of pure unadulterated joy and flying by the seat of your pants. The third act of the film is by far the best part of the film and is a real adrenaline rush. The flying sequences are the best I've seen in a film and as we know the actors were actually taken up in F-18s to film these sequences and that's what makes this film so ruddy good.The only thing that made me go really? Was a part involving an F-14 Tomcat near the end. But, I guess they had to shoehorn one in at some point within the film. Other than that I'm ready to see the film again and most likely will. Or wait until later in the year when it appears on Paramount Plus.Seriously though, it genuinely is a great film and is best watched in the cinema.\n",

            "Review: Our rough and scrappy title character Maverick - still Captain, nonetheless - gets a call back to TOPGUN, but as an instructor. His mission is to teach a bunch of cocky young pilots to basically re-create the main battle scene from that war in the stars movie where the star of death gets blown up after flying the gauntlet and the super Hail Mary shot right in the hole. Totally phoned it in, so glad I was able to view this one gratis.\n",

            "Review: Nostalgia is awesome and reliving fond memories is always a treat. But a return to 'Top Gun' is just laughable. Have you ever walked into someone house and noticed how everything is pointed at their television? Make the TV Tom Cruise and everything in the house the \"supporting cast\", and there you have this production. It's unemotionally sad. I don't expect quality from a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and God knows I've never heard of this director, but this was far below the nadir of my expectations. A little reminder, 'Top Gun' was a blockbuster back in its day, but it was never brilliant, edgy, nor even memorable as a good movie. It was a guilty pleasure for the revved up 1980's crowd of excess to feel proud about during the 4th of July. Needless to say, it was a huge action film for anyone chanting \"America\" at fireworks. The point of its longevity belongs to the gay subtext Quintin Tarantino famously describes. The bashing of how-bad-a-film it was is legendary and continues on several social media sites. Today's tech-savvy sophisticated audience will never believe (reading the 10 star reviews) that this is the \"greatest movie ever made\". The plot was absolute garbage. It's a script that is pieced together from catchphrases, old panning shots of military aircraft, recycled aerial footage from 'The Transformers', and most notably the 'Star Wars' trench run. Seriously, they took apart the original 'Top Gun' (sans the homoerotic subtext) and pretended it was something fresh for today's audience. We have Pete Mitchell as the oldest test pilot in history still going by the callsign Maverick after 30+ years. The unnamed enemy jets introduced in the last frames because real writers would put production over budget. It's just a gross mischaracterization of entertainment. Where exactly were the military advisers to point out the obvious flaws? In my opinion; this is a film with a lot of cash thrown at it to feed the vanity of someone who can't get enough of themselves. I need not play Devil's Advocate here and point out this film was made to ego-stroke a bad actor who wishes he could be Robert Redford.\n",

            "Review: Maybe I'm writing this because I'm still a fighter plane pilot, I don't know. But it is notorious that Tom Cruise never flew a plane. The book of \"The daredevil, the authoritarian and the pretty lady\" is repeated (all the companions of Tom must be pretty?). Anyway, if it helps, I couldn't finish watching a movie that struck me like a déjà vu all the time.\n",

            "Review: I just want to say it's so impressive how real the movie looks and feels. All the scenes in the cockpit and of the planes themselves flying look 100% real. There are only 2 CGI shots (exterior shots of the laser guidance rocket system) where I felt like I was looking at CGI. The rest was totally immersive.The story, as you may imagine it's not some deep meaningful thing, although it has some more deep and thoughtful moments here and there (again not to much) it's a pretty straightforward gig but it works and it's good, solid.The actors do turn in some good performances particularly Miles Teller, I must say, Glen Powell also does a good job and Monica Barbaro and Lewis Pullman are breaths of fresh air, nothing over the top but they are good and bring something new.Overall it's a summer blockbuster popcorn action movie, but a damn good one.\n",

            "Review: I went to an early evening screening on a Wednesday evening here in Ireland and to the delight of my friend and I there was only one other person in the Cinema. This is the norm, before 19.00 here. The story started off with some slow moments, kicked into gear & delivered in punches. I enjoyed the original, a lot and it's one of the films of the 80s my friends & I loved and quoted, often. But as it got older the story was okay, a little introductory, laced with sadness. This one has a more intricate & interesting story with a cracking cast, like the first one. There is some antagonism with bravado & stunning cinematography. There was a dip in the story in the middle, maybe late in the film but it unfolds quickly as to why. This is a must see in the Cinema. Miss it at your own peril !!\n",

I simply loved every moment of Maverick, it's opening nod to the original and numerous, often subtle, throwbacks to 80's nostalgia. I found myself smiling throughout and also quite emotional too, the Val scenes particularly got me after watching the doc 'Val' recently, if you haven't seen it watch it! It's just a great film, some deliberate cheesy moments but they're by design not accidental and firmly compliment what has to be one of my favourite movies in years, if not of all time. It's just pure entertainment and exactly what the big screen is meant to be about, if you can revisit the original movie first like I did, you'll notice even more winks and nods and you'll likely enjoy it even more, top marks, 10/10!\n",

You don't have to stuff a cheap love story inside an excellent action movie just for the audience cinematic vibe. The movie was about teamwork, a suicidal mission. This kind of love stories are kinda cheesy nowadays. It blurred me out a little bit, looking for it was just a few scenes that won't ever affect the plot. All i say, you don't have to build a love story to achieve a good-written movie, the movie was perfect enough. I loved this movie quite much, maybe the best this year, but could have been legendary and historical by adding some spices!\n",

Cruise's devotion to great blockbuster film-making that avoids green screens and focuses on true practical effects shows in every frame and is all the better for it! Very few films have ever conveyed the feeling of speed and the sickening g-forces on it's characters as this one does. Then, masterfully, it unifies both films to form an immensely thrilling and emotionally impactful climax. TOP GUN 2 is mach-10 and then some,- a perfect sequel to a beloved classic that somehow manages to hit every single target.. including the return of that unforgettable soundtrack!\n",

Yet it didn't it has absolutely blown it away like a missile hitting a toy plane.Top gun maverick will have you feeling every emotion with not a single dull moment you will go from laughing to sitting on the edge of your seat unable to take your eyes off of the screen.The new characters fit into the franchise superbly which you will fall in love with in no time.Their is just the right amount of throw backs so it doesn't feel like the original top gun.A must watch top 3 film of the year so far.\n",

            "Review: Just got home from the \"movie of the year\", \"the God of action movies so far\" and all those \"call-signs\".I'm gonna use a classic here: \"not so faaaaaaaaaaast\" (Bugs Bunny).The overall feeling after viewing this \"Top secret\" (more-like!) movie is this: DISAPPOINTMENT.OK, let me explain. You cannot have a quality movie without a true villain, or at least an evil force of some-kind.The movie is about evolution of the good guys to some ecstatic point and then...nothing.You remain with your mouth open and wide eyes and you then say: you mean that's it??The villain in this movie is, lets call it STUPID, or let's name it for what it really is: A HOLE IN THE GROUND. In a nameless country...\n",
            "C'mooon people, IN THESE HARD TIMES IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH!The movie make cannot be politically correct, impartial and memorable , all in the same time.It is about taking sides, about choosing, and about assuming a clear position.Let me give a few examples:\n",
            "\"First blood\" - the villain was a fat redneck sheriff in \"Jerkwater USA\";\n",
            "\"First blood part two\"- the Russian bastards (He's dead now!!)\n",
            "\"Star wars\" - Darth Vader.... The Emperor...The Empire...The Dark side...Catching my drift here? Good.At least name the country for God sakes, there are plenty of declared enemies to the free World?! (Syria, Iran, North Korea, Russia, etc...).OK, if you do not want to upset the people there at least create ONE bad guy, and since this is a movie about aviation maybe they could create an enemy Ace with multiple air-kills , hated by everybody (and their families?). There!That is one aspect.The other aspect: the movie maker insisted on the VISUAL too much.The tech aspects that for the average viewers don't make sense (how many of the spectators really know what 1G is??) are described in detail. O this is not a movie for the naval aviators, is it not? Those guys are spending time in the gym, or learning procedures, or watching tactical videos, or FLYING MISSIONS.The cinematography looks good, maybe too good, but there is no real story behind it. Everything looks like a very well made computer game, with the difference that they are using real jets.Talking about jets: The movie begins with the biggest whopper in cinema history yet: you CANNOT trash a multi-billion $ hyper-sonic jet and make a career move after that, ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET, Maverick or not, Tom Cruise or not (maybe that is the reason the Navy didn't cleared Cruise on flying solo). The only way you will go is towards a penitentiary...after a gigantic Court Martial or a live TV law-suit.Anyways...\n",
            "What I am trying to say is: you do not need that much VISUAL to tell a memorable story. You only need a strong subject. And NO, enriching Uranium is not a good story, even the poorest countries in the world are doing it (Pakistan, India?). This subject is so OLD, literally.Nobody uses Uranium-based nukes since the 50's. Thermonuclear weapons were invented ? Helloooo?!?!You can achieve a monumental effect with so much less than IMAX cameras inside real life jets.By example: think of \"Dogville\". Totally unfair, not an action movie, so what? That is ART people, everything goes, and also \"no points for second place\"...\n",
            "A very strong cast, and a FEW LINES painted on the ground, a very strong story, developed scene by scene and you have your masterpiece right there.From a military point of view the movie is a joke, never in 1000 years will The Navy risk the lives of the best of the best to hit a hole in the ground, people crammed in 30+ yo jets. NEVER.The cruise missile (interesting choice of words, ha-ha) was invented, or a tactical nuke launch from far away, or a submarine parked right into your backside. Or a team of SEALS deployed on site. Or just pay the local government for a revolution, (lately)...\n",
            "Do not get me wrong, I am a fan of the original movie, I know it line by line, seen it dozens of times...but.... Maybe the cast was better in first part? Maybe the enemy jets had a red star painted on the tail (just about enough).Maybe the actors were stronger (James Tolkan, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside, even Meg Ryan, etc)..Maybe the script contained better lines for the actors, nothing from the first part can be found in the second part...\n",
            "One exception: Ed Harris, which had an extremely short appearance, misused resources if you ask me.Sorry, besides the deformed faces and the pilot going sideways as an effect of G-forces , got nothing left to take home with me. Oh yeah, and maybe some push-ups :))And those images are not NEW to me, watched it already on the Discovery channel :)\n",

The nostalgia element will appeal to the older audience, but the younger audience will be just as happy. I suppose it helps that modern-day films have better cameras and sound equipment to add to the atmosphere.At no point was I bored or twiddling my thumbs as the runtime necessitates quick storytelling. Yes, it's quite similar to the original but is that a bad thing? I don't think it is to be honest in this instance. A film that lives up to the hype.\n",

No other movie has left me in such an awe, but, I might be a little biased too because I was REALLY looking forward to it, worrying that it would disappoint me somewhere.The movie accomplished absolutely everything it set out to do. I loved how well they tied everything with the first movie.I believe I experienced every emotion possible during these 2 hours. Simply magnificent, well done everyone!\n",

            "Review: When I first saw the announcement of a Top Gun sequel, I chuckled a little bit. I didnt see how a sequel after more than 30 years could work. And many youtube channels predicted it would flop hard. I went to the theater wanting to see how terrible it was gonna be. I was completely wrong though. It's a perfect blockbuster movie. I liked the first Top Gun but never loved it. I LOVED this one. I was surprised to see Miles Teller's likeness with goose. And goddamn he's been working out. Unlike many sequels, Top Gun Maverick doesnt recycle its predecessor's storyline. Watch it. It's totally worth the price of admission.\n",

            "Review: Overall, really good action movie with heartfelt moments. Visuals are great and action and editing was stunning with great cinematography. I would suggest a refresh or intro by watching the first Top Gun to get the right setup.However, do expect some corniness and self-serving/glorifying setup at the start of the movie to establish or remind fans of the greatness of the lead character. The supporting actors were borderline B grade as they had to fulfill the 80s vibe interactions of fighter pilots in line with the 1st movie, but they did get corrected/refine as the show progressed.Would had hope there was a more prominent dedication to Tony Scott just at the start of the ending credits, but I heard there was one in the credits later.\n",

            "Review: I love this movie! Firstly, you've probably already heard this a bunch of times, but the scenes when they are in the jets are amazing. There's something about doing it for real which makes it incredible. I loved all the new characters, but Miles Teller and Glen Powell steal the show in regards to the students. Jon Hamm and Jennifer Connelly are also spectacular, and of course Tom Cruise was also amazing. This movie still feels like Top Gun, while shining as its own movie. The one thing I prefer in the first movie is the love interest. I actually prefer Penny over Charlie, but I prefer the love story in the original Top Gun more, but either way Penny is still a great character. The best part of this film is definitely the 3rd act, it is spectacular. The track is also amazing, from Lady Gaga's Hold My hand to OneRepublic's I Aint Worried. This is an all around great film, and I highly recommend you watch it.Overall I'd say it's 9.5/10, it's not perfect, but it's close!\n",

Top Gun was made the year I was born and days of thunder is my favourite movie so I have bonded watching Tom cruise over the years ofcourse by watching his films. How excellent of the producers to keep the music, ambience and some actors and storyline of the first one. And the chemistry between rooster and maverick and the way how it develops is just magnificent. I almost died crying when I thought maverick was dead! Then out of nowhere rooster saves his life. Then they fight together. He is just as goofy as his father goose too. I love love how maverick got back with the admirals daughter xD. From start to finish omg especially the start lol was just uplifting lots of action scenes and emotional scenes. Absolute 10/10 RIP tony scott in the end got me too xD I swear I'd cry less at a funeral.\n",

            "Review: I was preparing to be disappointed as I didn't see how a sequel to Top Gun would be able to work. They somehow figured out how to portray an older and a little wiser Maverick, still exciting, larger than life, reckless and charming while not ignoring his age. It immediately felt like a 30 year later or so Maverick would be!The ties to the original were not too much and not too little, with a new group of hot shots sharing the spotlight with the past. The new characters, (Rooster and Penny in particular) were worked in seamlessly and perfectly cast. Jennifer Connely was immediately a perfect fit for the love interest as well.In summary, I am not a serial high-ranker and a 9 is high praise, which this film deserved. This was my first time in a theater in over two years and this is ABSOLUTELY one to see on IMAX, or at least in a theater!\n",

With the death of the original director Tony Scott this got pushed back a few years but director Joseph Kosinski has tried to make the film feel like the original all the same. The yellow sunset/sunrise tints are there, there locations, the music and some of the classic characters.However it doesn't quite catch the magic or great character interplay like the first. It does have great aerial scenes especially in the third act. All in all it's an acceptable sequel with good performances from Tom Cruise and Miles Teller but feels a bit hollow and limp when we are not in the sky.6.5/10.\n",

            "Review: Tom Cruise really knows what he's doing. If you don't care for the original, you probably don't need to watch this and give it a 6/10 on IMDb.This movie is unashamed fan service, nostalgic yet modern day, with high octane action that delivers in every scene. This is pure cinema, pure blockbuster entertainment (not Shakespeare) and the perfect sequel - tailored for Top Gun lovers.Sit back and enjoy (at the theater!)\n",

            "Review: After the success of Original Top Gun 1986 , there.were a few other Military Fighter pilot films . Like Iron Eagle (1986) ,Into the Sun (1991) . They were OK for smaller budget film for the 80's and 90's period .Top Gun Maverick , the final 1/4 of the film , the story and plot element reminds me of the \"Iron Eagle\" and \"Into the Sun\" . All the nostalgic feeling of watching 80's and 90's fighter Pilot films .The Covid delayed the release for more than 2 yr , i is worth the wait .\n",

            "Review: This movie checks all the boxes. And depending on how you look at that might be a problem for you because this film really doesn't take any risks. People that know how this stuff really works might have a problem with the level of realism too. Some of the dogfights are technically outstanding. I enjoyed the score. As an 80s baby that loves the original they did a great job paying homage to it.9/10 for fans of the original. I won't bother giving it any other score for now, because that is very obviously who this film was made for.\n",

            "Review: Literally the first 1-second of this movie made my heart pound. Once you see it you'll understand. We saw this on an early premiere and it was so worth it. This movie must be seen in theaters! It's perfectly written with great Easter Eggs paying tribute to the first film. There is far more flying in this move than the original. And all the characters make sense. Especially Maverick's love interest. Far better than Charlie from the original. The crowd was cheering though out the movie. And standing ovation at the end. Such an aviation MASTERPIECE!\n",

            "Review: I struggled with rating this. I was between a 7 for story and an 8 for experiencing a movie going feeling I haven't had in years. I'm so happy I saw this at the theatre. It does not have as much charm and fun as the original. But, we are all in need of a popcorn big screen event and this delivers. You can tell there was a lot of effort put into the flight scenes which is why you should see it on the big screen. Tom Cruise is THE movie star of the last half century. They somehow made a war movie that stays away from any politics. The casting is great. The audience I saw it with on early access Tuesday made it fun. If you want an escape from the grueling topics of today, I highly recommend going to your local theater. I'd watch this by myself, on a date, or with the family. Go see it just don't set your expectations too high.\n",

I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.\n",

            "Review: SCORE: 10/10I actually feel speechless. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen in my life and I got to see it 3 days early in XD. Wow. I feel like that changed the way movies will be made forever. It was the perfect blend of old and new, with absolutely incredible audio and visuals and some of the best storytelling I've ever seen in a movie. I just witnessed history.There were multiple points in which the movie could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. Maverick saves Rooster and then Rooster saves Maverick and then they team up to escape just for Hangman to come save them. I was on the edge of my seat, emotionally invested, and inspired by the performances of all involved. But, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell stole the show.Could they have picked a better Rooster? Miles Teller was a spitting image of Goose and gave the performance of a lifetime. You could feel his pain and you could feel his struggle and how much everything meant to him. It was paired perfectly with Hangman's character, who was executed without flaw. That's what this movie was to me. Flawless.But this last part is for Tom Cruise. You can't tell me that man is almost 60. I won't believe you. His energy and charisma is what truly carried this film to a place in movie history. Hitting Mach 10, continuing to go after he hit Mach 10, going through the course in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. No matter what was thrown his way, he found a way to exceed expectations and teach everyone lessons along the way. His scene with Val Kilmer was so special. \"It's time to let go\". His struggle with how to handle Rooster being explained that his mother's dying wish was for him to convince Rooster not to take after his dad was powerful. I laughed at the many moments of perfectly timed humor, I was sucked in during the moments of breath-taking action, and I cried during every emotional moment this film had to offer.\n",

            "Review: Having rewatched the original in preparation, I can safely say this is a neat 2022 restoration. The plot slightly tweaked, each scene touched up and carefully put back in place, all with the exception of the main mission, which is essentially the same tactical plan Luke Skywalker and the rebellion had to destroy the Death Star.All this doesn't matter though, cause this film is a FILM. Loud, fun and intense. I had a fantastic time watching it on the big screen. The third act is what action movies are all about. Edge of your seat excitement.Top Gun (1986) premiered the same year my mum pushed me out into the danger zone. Tom Cruise may not have grown as much as me in 35yrs, but his balls certainly did!\n",

The use of live action gives the film a visual weight, in contrast to the CGI-heavy snoozefests Hollywood has been pushing out for the last few years.

Some of the new characters don't get much development, but the familiar characters are just as charming as they were in the original. The scenes involving fighter planes are well done and the sound of them is spectacular, the special effects are very few, which is good, and they are good. The performances are good and can be very emotional.It is a very good sequel, since it understands the story and the original characters, as well as the emotional moments that are very significant, just as the new story is very enjoyable, this sequel makes us have more affection for these characters and the original story.\n",

            "Review: Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the \"Top Gun\" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of \"Goose\" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' \"Danger Zone\" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.\n",

            "Review: This was literally Star Wars: A New Hope but instead of a Death Star it's the inside of a mountain on Earth. Instead of X-Wings it Was F-18's.It involved a trench run, no missile guidance system, a \"one in a million Shot\", and getting out of Dodge before the whole thing blows, get back to base and have the entire carrier run up to them to lift them \"onto their shoulders\".The only thing it lacked in similarity was the rewards ceremony at the end with two droids shaking and making beeping noises.Tom Cruise is Obiwan, Miles Teller is Luke Skywalker, Jennifer Connolly is Princess Leia, and Glen Powell is Chewie.Save yourself the time and and money and just watch Star Wars: A New Hope again and pretend they're in F-18's.\n",

            "Review: Top Gun has been an 80's staple since it first released and remains a classic action film to this day. Even so, it's hard to believe they would come back to it over 30 years later. When it was first announced that this would be happening, bringing back a now nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise as character Maverick, I was highly skeptical. Shouldn't Maverick be retired by now? The trailers for the film didn't do much to sway my opinion. Then the positive reviews came in and I was still skeptical.Having seen the film, I was completely wrong. This is easily one of the years most entertaining films yet. With the completely dependable Tom Cruise not missing a beat, easily stepping back into the shoes of Maverick, and high flying, practical action that will...ahem...take your breath away, this 36-years-later sequel surprised the hell out of me.The film's overall structure is pretty similar to the original film, with lots of training at Top Gun followed by a tough mission. We meet the near dozen characters whose top tier pilots will be taking on the mission. The biggest difference here, put out early on in the film, are that the stakes are immediately raised. This is no longer just following the pilots as they train, leading into a military career. The nearly impossible mission these pilots are to be sent on is laid on the table right away. We know what's to come. There's also an emotional elements established outright, with Maverick still filled with guilt over the loss of his friend and ROI from the first film, Goose. This is compounded by Maverick having a soured relationship with Goose's son, Rooster, played by Miles Teller. We also get some familiar character types here, the most notable being Hangman, who is the pilot that most comes across as how Maverick was in the first film.The film's emotional and more visceral stakes are well established and keep the film feeling like more than just another retread of the original film, but even if you don't feel a strong connection to those aspects, you'll likely still find yourself entertained. There's no shortage of action here and it's all superb. Cruise wanted this done with practical effects and it really translates into an adrenaline pumping, well shot, exciting time. The aerial action is outstanding, shot well and trumping anything we saw in the original film. It all leads up to what is arguably one of the most exciting aviation scenes ever produced for screen.As someone who doesn't necessarily call myself a huge fan of the original film, I wasn't expecting this to be something I would like as much as I did. I figured the film would lean hard into the nostalgia and give us a little bit of action, but I should have trusted Tom more. His high standards show here and director Joseph Kosinski, who's body of work (including previous Tom Cruise collaboration Oblivion) would never suggest he would deliver something of this caliber, has certainly left a mark demonstrating his action filmmaking capability. This is a movie likely to go down as THE blockbuster of the summer, even amidst major releases like Jurassic World: Dominion, Thor, and Bullet Train. Film goers looking for an exciting, action packed good time in the theater need look no further.\n",

I'm that guy that knows every line and would annoy you sitting next to you watching it.... Maverick was almost as good as the original...

            "cried. Walking out of the IMAX everyone was talking how amazing of a movie it was. If Iceman and Goose weren't in the original and played amazing by Val and Anthony this would surpass it... so it's a 1b to a 1a.Tom you did it and you make movies enjoyable and I wish there was a fountain of youth because you give the fans everything they want... I know you turn 60 in a few mths so I'll just keep enjoying your art as long as you can do it! You are an amazing entertainer and do it the right way on screen! Thank you!\n",

            "Review: Remember the last time you were in a movie theater, and realized that your jaw dropped for awhile? Or when a scene is so thrilling that you find yourself on the edge of your seat, holding your breath? Well, I lost count of how many times I felt like this watching Top Gun Maverick. A sequel that is superior in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY to the original film.Top Gun, from 1986, is a great action movie, no wonder it became a classic, but we have to admit that it has its flaws, a little relevant plot, which is basically two guys arguing about who has the biggest dick. Top Gun Maverick is arguably more polished, layered, tense, and emotional. We start the film with several established relationships between Maverick and other characters, such as his friendship with Iceman, and his relationship with Penny (Connelly), which doesn't need to be didactic for us to realize all its nuances and complexities. The mix between the old and the new is very present here, including references to the original flick, without ever seeming out of place, or mere fan service. I don't know if I need to talk about the action scenes, but they're absolutely mind-blowing. The sound effects and soundtrack will leave anyone with goosebumps. The CGI doesn't draw attention to itself, and a lot of the visual effects are practical, which brings a wonderful physicality to the action.The supporting cast is very efficient, with Hangman being an updated, and even more douche, version of Iceman, but without the same personality and presence as Val Kilmer's character. Miles Teller also doesn't shine much, but he does a good job. Tom Cruise is the absolute standout, no exceptions.Perhaps something that Top Gun Maverick lacks is the courage to let go of some characters. Despite having moments of life or death, literally, where we feel like anything can happen, there is no real risk, which ends up taking some of the weight off the mission.A film that really deserves the title of Blockbuster, which goes beyond the a mere action movie, and delivers us an exciting, mind-blowing and chills-filled adventure.\n",

The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine. He knows what audiences want and he delivers. Not sure how they can top this one (but I thought the same after watching him cling onto a plane).You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience.

            "Review: Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.\n",

You get what is expected of a movie like this, but without a doubt the plus for this one is a super entertained, emotional and immersive film. The sound is great and the air sequences are exciting in a manner you can feel the passion , the excitement the pilot is feeling in their seat. I really loved the air sequences, cannot say right now another movie to highlight in that regard. Again, air sequences are fantastic. FANTASTIC. So real, so natural view, so immersive. Sound is great and of course IMAX is recommended. I loved the cast, all of them are nice and welcomed additions. There are some very emotional scenes that worth the ticket alone. Plot, is made to enjoy. Every bit. Lovely references to prior movie and superb cinematography. Music is good, however didn't find a new classic song for my particular taste, but maybe there is one for you. Super enjoyable product, the one that put you to search where to learn to fly. Absolutely recommended to see it in theaters. So IMMERSIVE experience that not even the best home theater will match. Well, if The Godfather had The Godfather 2, Top Gun has Top Gun Maverick.\n",
