3339,top gun maverick american american movie one run minimally two hour dont count closing credit add another ten minute director joseph kosinski first time worked lead actor tom cruise get little later cast character case kosinski new filmmaking also extremely experienced worked film also include american hero character since breakthrough picked one kinda make sense key writer peter craig maybe bigger name involvement hunger game franchise newest batman movie also town maybe best come far case parallel kosinski big breakthrough ten year new millennium two writer credited come original top gun movie year ago approximately check name like one still alive wonder think quality new film high praise received far justified director tony scott died decade ago read name also end film word crew could say namely music department name harold faltermeyer han zimmer lady gaga movie sure make something unique must say gaga fan though song towards end also almost nothing see score another oscar nomination hope yeah german surely focus two german mentioned let look cast really beginning end tom cruise oscar winner jennifer connelly play love interest mile teller whiplash play protagonist former wingman son mad men jon hamm play closest antagonist val kilmer think one except cruise course reprises role old film look lot like jon voight meg ryan there others course also check list careas film sure ever seen american pathos one movie consequence unfortunately pretty much every single character felt fairly stereotypical yet somehow went right would agree raving review extremely high average rating genuinely entertained beginning end mean probably biased like cast member huge fan cruise personal life none business mile teller one younger actor really like jon hamm always joy watch simply love mad men also one playing smaller character totally fine glen powell best example seemed familiar maybe face could really say saw also possibility character could end antagonist eventually opposite case maybe coolest moment film show save two central male character say fit people military stick together really one team one unit could one become true antagonist maybe criticize character refers female character great deal depth applies connolly role sure maybe also monica barbaros character even super easy eye one military character get lot screen time even le elaboration despite making cut time admire cruise character admittedly move bit away gender talk also say bob much screen time either creates laugh introduced military nonnickname like others initially know yet carrying bar next day rude awakening happens oh yeah barbaros character also moment hangman criticized antifemale another reference could think maybe bad guy cocky thats also others like much teller character sure want latter team leaderi agree saying perhaps last half hour highlight kept mission pretty simple early still seems almost like casting show get eventually focus mission exactly namely hit two precision shot destroy radioactive substance belonging enemy time make shot also quick get safely afterwards emphasized especially one occasion cruise character film fittingly named talk hamms oh way enemy explicitly stated called rogue state rogue nation see bad guy face either one thing know rather cold said country honi soit qui mal pense know mean politic event okay film made let get detail focus film instead must get detail gimmicky film felt time almost much sometimes crossing fine line entertaining simply overthetop applies almost everything involving connellys character literally see fall daughter tell cruise character hurt maybe funniest moment film see jumping mother window word tell connellys character one one occasion also fairly gooeythere scene feel awkward side mean like cruise people dont could really struggle also hamm look end finally accepts greatness kilmers character dy one occasion maverick beach make sure gang becomes team show u great topless body well easily strong enough shape take youngster like training many moment course must mention scene cruise character pretty much loses job show everybody capable possible get mission done process steal priceless plane well hamms character word reaction also entertaining watch even bit exaggerated made actor mean ever doubt cruise character would fly mission teacher probably mean doubt would make alive end everybody knew mission would success also teller character would live could always think cruise maverick would die hero eventually happened another big franchise recently enough good let guy center live timei must also totally mention flight sequence nothing short spectacular heart soul film course landscape snow true highlight towards end also called dogfight end evil pilot guy true highlight use really show pilot come man versus man potentially inferior plane also pay attention recurring idea dont think also quite edge cool much good id say like mach extremely early wasnt enough yet maverick take earth quote hilarious maverick surely survives really many critical situation air plane coming fast drama coming flocking bird character losing consciousness elephant metaphorically sitting chest nice entertainment sure surely lot could mention oh yes ed harris prologue could forget also think established nice tie original movie good job suggest watching one right see one mustdo course nicely understand story well without even heard film requirement know seen one yeah give top gun maverick surely thumbsup honest almost felt point sitting flight simulator cockpit scene convincing way could one say anything negative film cruise show world premiere helicopted flew doubtful coolest guy ever right man role miss quality film
